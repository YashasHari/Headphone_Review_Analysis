R1UGHCCYN8419,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect headphones.,RowNut405,5,"I have had my Powerbeats Pro for about a week now and after a bit of a rocky start and an adjustment period, I find them to be almost perfect headphones. When I first put them on, I was wildly disappointed. They were uncomfortable and sounded tinny with no bass at all. I genuinely believed I would be returning them and getting second gen Air Pods instead. But, given how excited I was for the Powerebeats Pro to come out and the cost, I decided to put in a little effort and give them a chance. It wasn't until about 3 or 4 days in that I decided to keep them.So, if you are like me and think your new Powerbeats Pro sound like garbage when you first put them on and you wonder if all the positive reviewers are high, experiment with all the tips before dismissing the headphones as crap. In-ear buds need a good seal to sound good. I have freakishly small ears so I always start with the smallest tip available when trying out new headphones which usually works for me. Not this time. It sounded awful and I was briefly outraged that I had paid $250 for garbage. It was counter-intuitive, but I finally tried the biggest tips instead which gave me a good seal and let me wear the headphones without having to go as deep into my ears which made them more comfortable too. Once I found the right fit with a good seal, I discovered that yes, in fact, these things do actually have some nice ear-thumping bass. I think the bass is better than original Air Pods but also not overwhelming as Beats products have a reputation for being. It's satisfyingly skull shaking without being distorted and is balanced out nicely by clear highs. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I won't listen to any old crap either. I like a little bass and good clarity and the Powerbeats Pro deliver.My biggest issue with these is comfort. As I mentioned, I have freakishly small ears and while I have been using Air Pods for a couple years, I was doing so with discomfort. I put up with a little paind because of the convenience of function. I love the automatic connection, the ability to use one bud at a time and charging on the go in the case. So, when I first read about the Powerbeats Pro, I was expecting something that would have the convenience of Air Pods with better comfort and something that wouldn't fall out of my ears all the time. Generally, I do okay with headphones that have different sizes of silicone tips so I was expecting the Powerbeats Pro to be a comfort upgrade. Initially, they actually hurt my ears more than Air Pods, especially my right ear. I fully blame this on my freakishly small ears. I'm one of those people who often finds ""one size fits all"" to be laughably ridiculous. Again, I was determined to love these things so I tinkered a bit to find an acceptable level of discomfort. The largest tip allows me to get a good seal without having to put them in so deep, relieving some pressure and cutting down on pain. When I first tried them, I could only last about 20 minutes before the pain forced me to take them out. After adjusting to find a good angle and replacing the silicone tips with Comply Sport tips, I'm a lot more comfortable and can last 2 or 3 hours before I feel discomfort. Even then, I would call it discomfort and not outright pain. It's discomfort I can live with and not any worse than what I experience with Air Pods. Also, my discomfort is only in my right ear instead of both like I get with Air Pods. Since I go with one bud a lot of the time, I'll just use the left one. No biggie. I can't blame the manufacturer for my tiny ears which is why I'm not taking away a star.On the plus side, the fit is very secure. I have worked out in them several times and they don't budge. I never could work out in Air Pods because they fell out all the time. I can also wear these while laying down which I couldn't do in Air Pods without them falling out periodically. Also, the connection is great. Original Air Pods used to randomly lose connection or not connect when they were supposed to. The chip upgrade in the Powerbeats Pro seems to have resolved this little annoyance. They connect faster and after a week, I haven't experienced a drop or glitch once.The Powerbeats Pro do come with a tradeoff when it comes to the size of the case. If you are used to carrying around Air Pods in your pocket in their tiny case, forget about it with Powerbeats Pro. The case is significantly larger. It goes in a bag or purse without taking up a ton of room but it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. The extra battery life for Powerbeats is nice though. I frequently use one bud at a time and used to drain an Air Pod and have to switch ears regularly. I'm using the Powerbeats Pro the same way and haven't drained a bud yet. I'm okay with the bigger case since the better battery life makes me feel secure about leaving the case at home when I need to go bagless.So in summary, these are the best sounding buds I have used. They are super convenient, easy to connect and won't fall out of your ears. If you have normal human sized ears, they will probably be comfortable and the battery life is great. You have to deal with a bigger case but the positive improvements over Air Pods make the size trade-off worth it. If you don't hear the bass, try different tips and twist them around a bit before you give up. Hopefully you won't have to work as hard at it as I did to find your happy place with Powerbeats Pro but the effort has been worth it. These are really great headphones and worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2019",AEZQV6K6UB6ELDP4O35DTDLARIRQ,TRUE,1037,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2WMIQOXTJA88Q,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Earphones you will ever buy...,Mike,5,"These are probably the best Bluetooth earbuds I have ever bought. There is one bug, but it is very easy to fix and it rarely happens. Occasionally (I am saying like once every 3 months), the earbuds will disconnect from my device and stop playing sound. The easy fix is to turn off Bluetooth and turn it back on. I have read reviews of similar occurrences and people are thinking it is Bluetooth interference. I do not think that is what it is. Just happens randomly. I use them every day and sometimes I lose connection with no other Bluetooth devices around. But other than one small bug, these earbuds rock! I will use one earbud at a time and rotate them when one earbud is low. Each earbud lasts about 9 hours and the base charges an additional 24 hours, which means I make my earbuds last about 42 hours. Bluetooth range is excellent. Sound quality is excellent. Does get loud but it does not completely cancel out sound (like a vacuum running). Earbuds are very relaxing on the ears and I wear them all day. Works with my 2 computers, Windows and Chromebook. Works with my Samsung S8 and my Samsung tablet. I do have an old iPod touch (gen 2) and it did not support it. But these are made for apple so you will get the most of it using an iPhone. Did some research and with the iPhone, you can use Siri by holding down the button on the earbud and you can get a battery status of the powerbeats on the phone. Android, Windows, and Chromebook do not support these features. Unless there was an update recently and they fixed it. I tested all of this out months ago when I first got my powerbeats. What I love the most about these powerbeats is the security of the earbuds. To sync to new devices, the user must hold down the sync button, then connect. Once connected, the user can connect to the earbuds when they are not connected to another device. Let me give you an example. I have these connected to my laptop, phone, tablet, etc. I can take one earbud with me and put in my pocket. The charging base is at home and I am out doing errands. I can turn on my Bluetooth on my phone, find the powerbeats under Paired Devices, and it connects. I then can disconnect from my phone and connect to my tablet. Once they are connected, they remain connected. It will never switch devices. The earbuds are never in discoverable mode unless you sync them. So, someone else that has Bluetooth on and is searching for a device will not even see it, even though it is not connected to anything. With most Bluetooth devices, if it is on and disconnected, people can see the device. The last thing I will talk about is the sensor in the earbud. So far it works with all my devices. If I take out my earbud, the music or movie that is playing will stop and once I put the earbud back on, it resumes on its own. I guess one thing I do not like is that there is no battery indicator on the charging base. I will use them every day and forget to check the battery life on the charging base. Usually every 2 or 3 days I will charge the base to make sure it is always charged. Whenever the Powerbeats Pro 2 come out, hopefully they add this feature. Like 4 lights on the bottom, indicating 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The 25 should blink when almost dead. But other than that, I love my powerbeats pro!","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFCOUVNYR4HCD3YRXCTDVFA6JI3A,TRUE,54,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RYGNKCJF3Q2P3,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro!,Patrick,5,"I want to preface this before I say anything about these headphones: I primarily use headphones for music and podcasts while I am cycling, running, or sitting at my desk at work. I use Spotify for music, and I am not an audiophile. I am not comparing these to a pair of Sennheisers with a lossless audio format as my source. I also am using an iPhone 7+ and iPad Air 2 for my devices in this review.I have been waiting on a getting a pair of truly wireless headphones because none seemed to be worth it to me. The battery life is usually dismal for obvious reasons, and most had complaints of cutouts between the earbuds. Some friends of mine have Air Pods and they all said they didn’t have cutout issues and battery life was pretty good. But, I just didn’t like the design of the Air Pods and they sounded “hollow” to me. But I get their appeal.I am so glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro (PBP)! I was using the Jaybird X3 before I got these, and I think the sound is on par with them. One of my main annoyances with the X3’s was that the cord would tug once sweat built up on my neck while exercising, and I couldn’t use the cable shortener they provide because of the way my helmet is. I went for a bike ride yesterday with the PBP’s, and they were fantastic! It was a little windy, so I did get a little wind noise. I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these because I think that would make the noise isolation much better. My ride was around 2 hours and I still had 80% left on the PBP battery.Cons:1. The case: it’s actually smaller than I thought, but would still be uncomfortable in a pocket. I think the 9 hour battery life on the actual headphones make this acceptable, but this may be deal breaker for some.2. Ear fatigue: I didn’t have any fatigue during my ride, but my ears were definitely a little sensitive where the hook was resting after I took the headphones off. I’m hoping this gets better as I wear them.3. Like the Air Pods, the PBP’s can only be connected to one device at a time. They will pair to all Apple devices on your iCloud account, but if you want to switch between devices, you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and select them. On Android you will need to pair each device separately.4. I usually listen to a podcast when I go to sleep. These are not comfortable to lay on if you are side sleeper like I am. Also, the button the headphones will get pushed by the pillow. The button doesn’t require much force, which is great because your not shoving the headphones into your ear. Not a huge deal, but just thought I would mention it.Pros:1. Great sound for Truly wireless, I think.2. Great fit for exercise.3. Pretty good sound isolation, but like I said, I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these.4. Actual headphones are smaller than I thought they would be, and they don’t look weird on you when you are just walking down the street.Bottom line, if you use an iOS device and use headphones while exercising, I can’t recommend these enough! In my opinion, the $250 price tag is worth it given where other truly wireless headphones are priced.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2019",AFC6P5DEIQ7DYDV66DZV6TBFB3IA,TRUE,1299,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1OI66NEAOV8TP,B07R5QD598,"5.0 out of 5 stars Well done, Beats! I would buy again... and again... and again!!!",Dillon & Cassandra,5,"I have had these for one day now and so far I love them. They are my first Beats and they have lived up to the name. They fit very snugly but also comfortably which has been hard to find. Sound quality is fantastic. I’m not an expert on sound by any means but I am very pleased with the sound from my music, podcasts and even phone calls.I have an iPhone and pairing was almost too easy to the point that I wasn’t sure if they were really paired until I started listening. It also has a nice little display when you open the case near your phone that shows battery level of the earphones as well as the case. (The case charges the earphones when they are in place).They feel very well made which was to be expected as they are Beats (Apple) after all. The case is also very nice. It’s slightly larger than expected but it could easily fit in my jacket pocket so I’m not complaining. The case has a high quality feel to it with one exception: when fully opened, the lid seems to wiggle as if it were a little loose. This was definitely not a deal breaker for me considering I didn’t buy it for the case, but rather the headphones. Just something to be aware of. When you close the case, it resumes the nice feel with a sort of snap that I’m guessing is from a magnet.As I said before, the earphones are very comfortable. I could wear them for hours and not get sore ears. I am not an athlete but I am constantly moving around the house and leaning over etc. and they will stay in until you take them out. Another benefit is that if you slightly twist them forward on your ears, it breaks the seal so that you can hear what’s going on around you, but you can still hear your music etc. it would have been nice if they had integrated the transparency technology that uses the microphones for you to hear through the actually earphones what’s going on around you but this feature works just as well. In the booklet, it mentions adjusting the “around-the-ear” hook but it seems like it just bends to different angles. My only complaint about this product which isn’t really by fault of the beats is that the hooks rub against my glasses a little. It’s not enough to make me return them and I only notice it sometimes. It’s really just a minor nuisance, but if you’re the kind of person that would be bothered by that, don’t get ones with ear hooks. It comes with 4 sets of in-ear rubber pieces. One of them on the earbuds and the other four in the packaging. So far I haven’t switched them out because they felt just fine with the ones that were already on.This brings me to packaging. I thought the packaging was excellent. Again, I expect this from a product made by Apple and I was not at all disappointed. It felt like opening a very intricate gift.Overall, I LOVE this product. I was hesitant about the price to begin with but after having them, I realize it was well worth the sale price of $170. I would even pay the previous price of $200 for them. I would absolutely recommend these! Especially if you have an iPhone (for simplified pairing and connectivity) and if you want something that stays in but doesn’t hurt (who wouldn’t want that??)!","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2020",AE6VVWAS3GJMQ7KNIXVV7UE37TXA,TRUE,4,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RT337LQW55P9W,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Running Earphone Showdown - These were my winner,Joe,4,"EDIT: 4 months inThe sound quality of these headphones are still great and I'm still really pleased with these being my final choice. That being said, I'm dropping it from 5 stars to 4 because the connectivity issues and power issues are driving me insane. And the fact that these are premium earbuds while still having these issues is just inane. Also, I have an android, so I'm not sure if these issues exist with Apple users or not (I'm guessing at least the second issue does, if not both).First: when you put the earbuds back in the case, you have to really work at finangling them inside the case to make sure they actually register as being put away and auto disconnect from the phone. This isn't the biggest issue, it's just maybe a 30 second annoyance. But 30 second annoyance every single time you put them away gets to be more and more annoying.Second: The earbuds have been losing charge inside the case. This didn't ever happen before until I recently went on a trip and flew somewhere. The earbuds were fully charged before takeoff, and completely dead at landing. I have no idea why this happened, but I assumed it was a fluke. It happened again on the way back. Since then, the earbuds have been draining to 0% in the case without me using them. I'm not sure if this is causation or even correlation, or just pure terrible coincidence. But it is infuriating. I'm showing up to workouts and can't use them because they're dead. It's also worth noting that I did the software update around the same time as the travel, so it could be because of that software update rather than something weird about flying (which probably makes more sense).Either way, it's absolutely infuriating.Again, sound quality is still there, but the stars will continue to drop if I can't get a fix at least for this second issue.Original Review:I was looking for new earphones specifically for fitness with the main usage test being running. I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same people","Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2023",AFSRAJU6KF7ZSMZHCEC3IM34FTLA,TRUE,208,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R7FPOTZIXQMHE,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional Performance,Fadi Shamaan,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and I am extremely impressed with their performance. These earbuds are truly exceptional in every way and I would give them a 5 out of 5 star rating.Firstly, the sound quality of these earbuds is outstanding. The bass is deep and the highs are crisp, providing an overall clear and balanced sound. Additionally, the volume can be turned up quite loud without any distortion, which is perfect for those who like to listen to their music at high volumes. The earbuds also provide excellent noise isolation, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your music.One of the most impressive features of these earbuds is their battery life. With up to 9 hours of listening time, these earbuds can easily last an entire day without needing to be charged. This is especially impressive considering the compact size of the earbuds. The charging case also provides an additional 24 hours of battery life, meaning you can go days without needing to charge the earbuds.The Beats Powerbeats Pro also feature the Apple H1 headphone chip, which provides a seamless connection to your Apple devices. The earbuds connect instantly and stay connected without any issues. The Class 1 Bluetooth technology also provides an excellent range, allowing you to move freely without any loss of connection.These earbuds are also sweat and water-resistant, making them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities. The earbuds have been designed to stay securely in your ears, even during the most intense workouts.Finally, the built-in microphone on these earbuds is excellent. The microphone provides clear audio and cancels out any background noise, ensuring that your voice is heard loud and clear on phone calls.Overall, I highly recommend the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds. They are an exceptional product that provides outstanding sound quality, long battery life, seamless connectivity, and are sweat and water-resistant.

Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on your personal preferences and needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AH2UZ52SQ4HSIYYUEBYBY6R76JEA,TRUE,126,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R18ML2DXNSHGXX,B07R5QD598,1.0 out of 5 stars I didn't know a product could be so poorly designed.,RIR,1,"This is a review for use with android and macbook proTLDR most glitchy product i've ever had in my life. Updates are few and far between and bring new glitches. Most common glitch is sound going out of sync between left and right resulting in delay, and feeling of echo in the audio: it's infuriating and requires disconnect and reconnect: sometimes with waiting in between or having to repair from box which makes the big bulky charge box a must carry everywhere: can't exactly go ona run with that thing.Imagine having to interrupt your sports routine 2-4 times to get these things working, does that make you want to work out more or less?Since i first bought them, they have been nothing but glitchy, and it took two months to have them replaced on apple care (because apple after sale service is a joke) so i made a glitch diary over the past few weeks to write this review.Android: many of these glitches are not android dependent but rather location/movement dependent, or where you put your phone dependent, or what your phone is touching dependent or next to what appliance you're standing dependent and sometimes audio app dependent (switching apps resolves the glitch).Glitches are ""seasonal"" they come and go, though some are constant. But there's always something new.-Worst and by most common glitch: the earbuds often go out of sync resulting in an echo (bc of the delay btw one ear and the other). This one is infuriating/maddening: happens everyday many times. Sometimes i just live with it because i don't want to go through the motions of disconnecting/wait/reconnect but the sync keeps drifting and it gets jarring/disorienting after a while: like chinese drip torture.- powerbeats connect, sound still comes from phone speakers-“skipping sound effect” from the connection faltering-sometimes nonstop struggle to stay in sync, stay connected-Sounds cuts in and out repeatedly with random intervals (on... off........ on.... off... on........ off...)-put them in a box and close it only to realize they’re still connected and the sound is coming out of the box still, but sometimes the opposite problem occurs: i'd be listening from macbook speakers and they. randomly connect to the laptop and start playing from within the box, and pause playback. Must turn off bluetooth on device to recover sound from speakers.-sometimes resumes all audio app after you pause and play (eg pause podcast, hit play, youtube, podcasts, audible all start playing together at the same time)- Different buttons/functions cease to work, sometimes all buttons won’t respond (sound plays buttons unresponsive), sometimes just some buttons, just volume or play, or just one earbud.-Sometimes buttons work but no sound (can see the app play/pause on the screen)-Sometimes connects (as confirmed by connection sound and bluetooth menu on phone) but no sound and buttons unresponsive. Sometimes no sound though buttons can play/pause-lag between commands and response (btw hitting play and music playing, pause and music pausing)- often disconnects from phone after a call: when you hang up sound resumes from phone speakers-sometimes disconnects during call making me run back to phone to continue call on phone- sometimes one of the earbuds ""forgets"" its charged straight out of the box, putting it back in the charge box ""reminds"" it it's actually full (goes from 0% to 100% immediately): imagine you put them on step out of the. house and realize one of the earbuds is acting dead, now you have to go back home, stick it in the huge box you don't want to carry around and. then g et back to your run/bike/routine-rarely, one earbud ""dies"" and needs to be placed in charging box for a long while before it comes back to ""life""-updates few and far between and bring new glitches- EVERYTIME I ride (bike) through specific intersections it ""slices"" the connection: audio goes out though the app continues to play and the connection is still established in the bluetooth menu.Recently (new ""seasonal"" glitches since last update ):-just doesn't automatically connect when i open box and put them on, I have to manually connect them from the bluetooth menu, sometimes i have to repair them from the box.- one ear starts playing immediately, other earbud takes 6-9 seconds to connect, during which you're standing there. waiting to see if it's this glitch or the one where one of the earbuds thinks it's empty and needs to be put back in the box to remember it's full.-earbuds connect but they don't make the connection sound so you don't know if they've connected or not without playing something- entire volume range is on the bottom three increments of the volume bar, goes from no sound (one volume click up) 50% volume (one volume click up) 100% volume and all the rest of the range no matter how much you volume up/down, remains at 100% volume.Macbook pro-refuses to connect/reconnect to macbook pro, no idea why, requires a factory reset and re pairing-randomly switches to another device mid use (from phone to macbook pro or vice versa)Sound Quality: bass ok, HIGH TREBLE many podcasts sound like there's a hissing in your ear when they pronounce the letter S. Overall sound is good but the hissing from the high trebble is annoying: one solution to this i found was to use biggest size rubber buds and shove them well into your ear: enhances bass and mitigates treble.Customer service: took nine days to ship them back to some facility to have them ""looked at"" decided they were fine within twenty minutes (i know this because they have a link to a tracker) and returned them to me (they had to overnight ship them when I blew a gasket at the store when i realized the confirmation email after nine days was just for their receipt of the product at the repair facility and not that they were done and ready for pickup: nine days, just to get from the store to the ""repair"" facility).Had to return twice more and both times same thing: they receive them, immediately decide nothing wrong with them, return them: spent the whole summer without the product i had bought SPECIFICALLY for that summer. In the end some ""genius"" i paris told me it was because they were labeling the problem as ""permanent"" as opposed to ""intermittent"" (permanent means it's always there and so it should show right out of the box)Please comment if you've been having any of these problems.thanks100% would not recommend","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020",AHODWZEEKYACPAUAQYJHC5MGJDQA,TRUE,179,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R1MY99OSW5FWG7,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Wireless Earbuds,Garrett,4,"These are really amazing wireless earbuds. I'm gonna do pros and cons along with some other thoughts about this product. This review is written 4 months after using this product.Pros:1. Battery life. The battery life is amazing. I never had these die on me except when I play video games all night. They also have fast charging which is very useful if you need to charge them real quick.2. Fit. The fit is really perfect. They feel comfortable and they stay in my ears perfectly. I exercise a lot and these earbuds always stay in my ears when I'm at the gym and when I'm running. If you are looking for some workout earbuds, then these will give you reliable and beautiful performance.3. Sound quality. The sound quality is amazing. Nice, clear and crisp.4. The Apple features. The extra features that the Powerbeats have when using with apple devices are nice but don't let those features discourage you android users from buying the Powerbeats. The features aren't important enough for you to decide not to buy them (Not gonna list out the features in order to make this review shorter)5. Range. The range is amazing. I can be listening to music on my phone and leave my phone in my room and walk anywhere in the house and still be able to listen to the music. The music starts cutting out depending on the amount of objects blocking the signal.6. Ability to wear with glasses. I can wear these with my glasses with no problem at all. I can take my glasses on and off and have no trouble.7. Good microphone. I use these earbuds for phone calls and video calls and the person can hear me pretty good. I can hear them perfectly fine. My brother tells me that I sound muffled but he can still hear me good.Cons:1. Pain. After wearing them for a couple of hours, I start to feel slight discomfort. This only happens after many hours so it isn't something i'm complaining about. Just felt like I should mention it so everyone is aware. The pain that is the problem is the major pain that comes after weeks of regular use. I'm not sure what is happening but it's like the Powerbeats is making the skin inside my ear peel off. I think this is happening because they are too tight in my ears. This has happened I believe 3 times and the goes away after I left my ears heal. As i'm writing this review, I am experiencing the major pain and I adjusted the left earhook so it's not as tight in my ear as before (Problem is currently only in my left ear). I'm not sure if I'm the only one who experiences this but if you can deal with this then don't let that discourage you from buying the Powerbeats (It isn't that big of a problem for me).2. Bluetooth connection on Windows 10 computers. I'm not sure if this also happens on other versions of Windows and android devices but sometimes there would randomly be a 1-2 second cut in the sound about every two minutes. This doesn't happen at all on my iPhone. I would also experience random disconnections on my laptop. Another thing about the connection is that it is weaker on my laptop than on my phone. Not sure why.3. Bulky case. This doesn't matter to me at all because I usually have a bag that I carry with me when I go to places that I can slip the case into. I'm just mentioning it so people can be aware. You can put it in your pocket if you want but it will look weird because there will be a giant bulge in your pants.That's it about the pros and cons. Now it's time to talk about the problems I had with the Powerbeats. I'm having flashbacks of the problems I encountered while typing this part of the review. Problem 1. This only happened once but I will still talk about it. I was connecting the Powerbeats to my iPhone and forgetting them in the bluetooth settings because I was enjoying the animation that pops up when you pair them with your iPhone. Then all of a sudden they would not pair again. Man I thought they were already broken and it was the day I got them. I thought my $200 dollars went down the drain. But luckily I managed to get them to pair again after a long time of research and trying different things. What fixed the problem was charging the case because apparently since it was at I believe 30 something percent, it couldn't pair. Problem 2. This was the worst problem. I've had this problem happen twice in the last month and a half. One of the earbuds would not pair and sound would only come out of the earbud that was paired. I had to switch back to my other pair of wireless earbuds that I previously had until I figured out how to solve this problem. It took days of extensive research and multiple solution attempts before I finally managed to fix the problem. I was about to return them but luckily I solved the problem before I did.Final thoughts: Despite the cons and problems I encountered, I would still recommend these earbuds to anyone. If you encounter any of the problems I did, I hope you can easily solve them and if you don't, you can reply to my comment and ask me for my solution. Hopefully Amazon has a feature where you get notifications when someone replies to your review. If you read this whole thing, thank you and I appreciate it. If you didn't then thanks for taking a look at it.Update: I no longer experience the major pain in my ears and the skin peeling off after I adjusted the earhooks to get the right fit (Update written on 8/18/21).","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2020",AGQAVC4ATJJ2TILHRYBPZTPL6CRA,TRUE,355,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

They have great sound, and they stay put in my ear through all movement and sweat. I thought these were the best exercise earbuds I had ever had, but of course right at the one year mark the left one stopped working. The left ear bud won't charge in the case no matter how much I fiddle with it.

R3705JNBSYTV9D,B07R5QD598,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy these if you want low maintenance earbuds.,Amazon Customer,3,"I was looking for a replacement for my Plantronics earbuds which loop around the ear so they don't fall off when I run etc. I really liked the Plantronics pair, but they were getting old and starting to have shorter usage time after each recharge. Unfortunately, Plantronics also seems to have stopped making them or bringing out new models since being acquired by Poly. I read some good reviews on Powerbeats Pro and it seemed like it would be a good replacement. I have had these for about 6 months now and here are my observations.Pros:1. Great sound - this gives you great overall sound. My previous earbuds were intentionally created to let outside noise in (for outside runners), so the quality of sound was never that great. With this, I do get great sound and depending on how snug you have them in your ears, they also block out some of the outside noises (but no true noise cancellation).2. Stays in place during the workout - This was a requirement for me and it works well.3. Connectivity with Apple devices - This was created as an Apple specific earbud. So it connects well with Apple devices and provides a lot of native functionality out of the box (just like AirPods) that you don't get with third party earbuds.4. Quick charging - You can get enough charge in 10-15 minutes to work out for a good 2 hours.Cons:1. No on/off button - There is no way to turn the earbuds on or off. They turn as soon as you take them out of the charging case (more on this later) and turn off when you put them back. So you have to carry the charging case with you if you want to have them with you for a longer period and do not want them fully discharged between use.2. Doesn't always turn on - I have had the issue when it doesn't turn on automatically when I take them out of the charging pod. So I will have to put them back in and out again AND double check they are turned on when I take them out again. Also, you have to make sure they are on in case you are leaving the house and not planning to take the charging case with you because that is the only way to turn them on.3. Bulky charging case- These aren't small (like AirPods or the Pixel ones) and not convenient to carry around when you are going out to work out.4. The right earbud seems to randomly turn on overnight and keeps discharging in the case - I researched this issue online and it seems to be a common problem for others who own them. Basically, you would leave them in the case to charge overnight (so they also turn off and disconnect from your phone). But if you check later, you might find that the right earbud is turned on and connected to your phone. Or most times, you take them out to go work out only to find that the right bud is at 10% or dying while the left earbud is at a 100%. So you are now stuck at home waiting for it to charge enough before you can leave.5. Buzzing noise on right earbud - This seems to happen sporadically too where you only hear a buzzing noise and no music. This also seems like a common issue from my research online. Based on advice from other users and Apple, I have disconnected and reconnected the earbuds and reset the earbuds several times to fix this issue. It has fixed the issue each time, but recurs after a few weeks.6. High maintenance - I don't know about you, but I would like something that I can use when I need to and forget about other times, except to put them up for charging. With #4 and #5 above, this has become another thing I need to worry about on top of everything else. I have NEVER had to worry about this in the past!7. Support - I tried to find support for this from Amazon and they pointed me toward Apple since these are supposedly distributed and sold by them. All I wanted was a fix to the above issues OR get a replacement for my earbuds which are still under warranty. But they want me to go into an Apple authorized store OR send these in and wait for them to fix it. Seems very convenient when it is something you use every day, right?Overall, if you are ready to put up with what I mention in the cons, this is still a great pair of earbuds that give really great sound for someone who loves music.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AGVDQ44DKPRDJQRZDUFFX2NV65DQ,TRUE,36,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2TRUA64RRPG39,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars This is probably the best you can get if you have mutant-sized ears like me,Hayden Wallsinger,5,"As a quick backstory, I have a huge head. I have never had a hat that fits nor in-ear earbuds. I had been using Skullcandy earbuds because they were small enough that I could kind of just jam them into the ear canal then push on them every few minutes to keep them in. I tried Airpods, about every skullcandy variant on the market, offbrand, and more. I am happy to say that the search is over!Everyone knows about the quality of the sound that Beats have. They are well known for it and since I used to own a pair of over-ear headphones by Beats I can comfortably say the sound hasn't really changed. The build quality is impressive and no material in the box feels tacky or cheap. Although the new iPhones are using USB-C for their cable which will make this obsolete for new phones, I do appreciate that I can use the same lightning cable for my iPhone 13 that I use to charge the docking holder thingy. One less cable I need to carry around.The fit is really good. Astoundingly good. I have always preferred over-ear loops to hold buds in because I can feel a bit more secure in wearing them and it helps to keep the buds centered. In addition to having large ears and a large head, I was also given large ear canals which constantly would spit out my previous skullcandy buds over time and make me paranoid that they were going to disappear. These still leave a bit to be desired for fit as they are just slightly too small for my ears. This all being said, I am a mutant with big ears and 99.99% of the population are going to find these fit like a glove.Finally, the smaller features of the buds really helps push them over the edge. Built-in detectors on the buds detect if you are taking them off and automatically pause the music/video you are watching. This is especially crucial for a person like me who regularly has to put them on then take them off when I get accosted by coworkers on a minute-by-minute basis. The volume controls are in a good spot and I appreciate that they are an actual button instead of some of the finicky touch controls that other companies use. Finally, I find the carrying case to be extremely bulky, but with the battery life I have experienced with these buds I am not at all going to complain about it. Manufacturer spec states 9 hours in ear with the charge in the case providing a total of 24 hours. They have to be going with the modest route! They have to be! I got 38 out of them on a work trip between Seattle and Dubai. I charged the case and the buds to the max before my flight than forgot to charge them while I was away. They died about 2 hours outside SeaTac on the return flight.Overall these are quality buds with good sound quality, great build, and a range of small stuff that eliminates the hassle normally encountered with bluetooth buds. If you get asked often, ""is your hearing good with ears the size of an elephant?"" than these buds are the one for you! If you are not shamed due to your large ears, they probably will work just as well for you too.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AF77BBBGGM7O3YF7WVQFILDXKNPQ,TRUE,27,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I've had this one for like maybe 6 months, and it glitches more than any of the other ones I've ever gotten.... also I noticed that the little beats logo on one of the ears is slightly crooked and doesn't click, which makes it seem like a fake maybe, i don't know... every now and again it just stops working (while fully charged), they're extra sensitive to touch compared to the other ones, to a point where I cannot wear dangly earrings... i don't know seems a bit suspicious but it's still working. thankfully I got apple care, so just waiting to see when I'm going to need to use it.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2024",AES765HOYJ26UZB4DN5FBU73A4RA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2KIEGX9V68B1T,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Get these while you can.,Mikecash_,5,"I purchased the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds November of 2022, it's July of 2023 right now and I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is rumored that there will be a new model coming out soon, which may be why the price of this model is currently on sale. I would get them at the price they are while you can!There are a few possible issues with these earbuds and if I could give them 4.5 or 4.75 I would, but the pros certainly outweigh the cons - perceived or real.Pros 1st:1. Sound quality. These are so much better than the bargain earbuds that I have always used that it's not even comparable. There is a very clear and crisp sound. On an airplane or in a crowded room, you can turn the volume up as high as you want and there's no distortion in the sound.2. Noise Cancelation. While not comparable to over the ear headphones for in-ear buds I can't imagine that you would get much better.3. Wrap Around feature. When I was deciding between the Powerbeats Pro and the Apple AirPods pro. It was the wrap around feature that was the tie-breaker. I have used these earbuds in a plane, in the gym, on a hiking trail, and various other places and I have never had them fall out of my ear - which is the point. I have helped others look for their in-ear buds on planes and in the gym and I didn't want that to be me.3. Battery life and charging time. I use these earbuds almost every single day. The battery has never been an issue. Some might consider that fact that the beats use the lighting cable instead of USB-C, but for me that has been a plus. I can charge the beats case in my truck with my iPhone charger if it ever gets to it. The old problem of the buds not sitting in the case correctly and thus burning through the charge on the case after you take off the charger has been resolved. Or at least it has never one time been a problem for me.4. Additional pros. The seamless connection to your Apple devices and the range after connection are worthy mentions. The built-in microphone provides clear audio that cancels out much of the background noise. And the sweat and water-resistant quality makes them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities.Cons:1. The ""Find My"" feature on iPhone is not very helpful for the Powerbeats. If they are paired you can find them if they are laying around the house somewhere, but I don't think it would be helpful at all if you leave them behind somewhere. And you cannot see them separately, you see both the left and right side together. This is certainly one area where AirPods would have the advantage.2. The size of the case. Compared to most earbuds this case is HUGE. Most people will not want to stick them in their pocket as you can with most others. I carry them in my backpack most of the time because of the size.3. The size of the ear tips. I have tried every set that comes with the beats and I'm down to the smallest size. They fit me perfectly but I do not have the smallest ear canals.One other thing to note: These work just fine with my glasses but the arms on my glasses are straight. If you have over the ear arms, it might be more of a problem.These earbuds are perfect for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds that can keep up with their active lifestyle.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2023",AFSNSQNQVEZTUVNT7BE4LEKOE6VQ,TRUE,213,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RZKYQ47MFPJKI,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars These Buds Don't Fall Out For No One!,Raenell,4,"I purchased these after I got Apple Airpods Pro because those fell out of my ears after I leaned over to get something that fell in my car. I was very bummed about the Airpods and tried the various ear fittings, but found that it didn't matter and bought them for running and working out at the gym. Upon ordering and receiving the Powerbeats Pro, I knew that they would be a great fit and was very impressed with the fit, the various sizes of buds (5 options) to find a great fit, and the battery life is amazing! Though they are not noise-canceling, I know that these will not fall out or off of my ears and will be great for running or jumping around at the gym. The downside to these, in my opinion, is that the level of sound has to be turned up quite high and makes me worried that I'm damaging my ears. I've checked this a few times to see if it's my phone or Spotify (iPhone 12), but it's not and I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing thing. The battery lasts a very long time and I've driven for hours talking and never have the person on the other end complain of noise like my old headphones. I love it too because when someone calls, it automatically goes to my earbuds if they are in and they connect quickly. I would recommend these because they are Bluetooth, convenient, and don't hurt to have them in. In the past, I've tried over-the-ear headphones, cordless or Bluetooth, and struggled with the fit and find that these are great.

R3AQHZ5W95PLS9,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars One of my best purchases,Michelle Benoit,5,"I had a bad experience with the original Powerbeats, but found myself drawn to the Powerbeats Pro. I contemplated getting either those or AirPods. Despite many people saying it wasn’t a problem, I didn’t like that the AirPods simply went into my ear without any way to secure them. I lift weights, and the last thing I wanted was for one of them to pop out at an inopportune time. I also didn’t like the fact that there was no volume control on the AirPods. The Powerbeats Pro allow me to adjust the volume from BOTH earpieces. That way if my right hand is occupied, I can adjust the volume with my left hand, or vice versa. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: #1 These headphones last a pretty long time on a full charge. They don’t last as long if you’re using them for a phone call, but if you’re simply listening to music, you will get 5+ hours out of them. #2 Again, I love that I can adjust the volume, start, stop, repeat or skip a song directly on my earpiece, rather than having to reach for my phone, which is often buried at the bottom of my bag. #3 I’m sure the AirPods do this as well, but I love how the Powerbeats Pro integrate with Siri once you allow the right settings. I don’t even need to touch my phone or my earpiece, I can simply say “Hey Siri” and ask the time, the weather, what a word means, have someone on my contact list called or messaged, etc.Cons: #1 I wish the earpieces were truly adjustable. They don't come with different sizes of inner-ear pads, and the over-the-ear hooks don’t adjust as much as I would like. At times they can feel uncomfortable and somewhat painful. #2 I learned the hard way that despite it being an added burden, it might be a good idea to take the charging case with you when you leave the house. I’ve been out while all of a sudden, one of my headphones stops working despite having a substantial charge. The only way to reconnect both pieces is to place them back in the carrying case and re-pair. #3 Sometimes if you don’t sit the headphones onto the charging prongs correctly, one (or both) might not properly charge. That can be very frustrating when you’re ready to use them. When you go to Bluetooth settings on your phone and first connect them, sometimes a box will pop up letting you know how much power is left in the case, as well as the charges on the earpieces. If you pull only one of the earpieces out, it will tell you the charge of each piece individually. Unfortunately I don’t always receive that dialog box, which is very helpful.Overall, I absolutely LOVE my Powerbeats Pro, and they are certainly one of my favorite and most satisfactory purchases. In fact, I love them so much that I own two pairs of headphones and alternate between both. I like throwing one into my gym bag as a backup, just in case I need it.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2021",AEDCHMFS55CNEVNVFN7JVEQVYZSA,TRUE,2,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I really prefer these over airpods because they wrap around your ear so they don't fall out. They have gotten really sweaty and still work great. I used them for work meetings as well and have done just fine. My only gripe... I was constantly switching my bluetooth connection between my personal phone, work laptop, and work cellphone, and there were times that it would get really buggy and I would have to completely forget and re-pair my headphones to get them to work again. I have since switched jobs so I do not experience this anymore, but it will still be buggy with Spotify, saying they are connected when they really aren't.

R37DEWR5YZ3SZP,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Can't believe it's been four years,Maggie The Red,5,"Y'all can tell me if this is a good buy, but I've had these Beats earbuds now going on to 4 years. At first I thought, what is wrong with these I just got these and the battery seems to only last 2 hours, well I looked back at my history and realized I've actually had these for 4 years and I use them A LOT! I love to have them in while I'm working and listen to YouTube or TV or just talk to a friend so I can still work with my hands. I walk the dog and talk with my mom, or whatever it is, I'm multi-tasking but recently realized these Beats are dying on me. So I thought it was good that these have lasted me almost 4 years. Is that good? Electronics don't seem to last as long as they used to. These are comfortable and have definitely stood up to a lot of use. Friends have told me that Apple iPods don't last this long, so I think I'm going to get myself another pair of these Beats. I paid about $150 for these on a Black Friday special, so that's $42/yr if you figure 3.5 years use.

R2Q1CA4D9VFS5C,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Good,Tim,4,"I've had these almost 2 years now. They're good headphones and are worth the price when on sale if you're an Apple user.Comfort is important since I bought them for working out and walks and I have no major complaints there. These are pretty lightweight despite the large package and stay in the ear well. I don't have any issues wearing these for a few hours. I also appreciate the hardware buttons: one large button for play/pause and skip, and dedicated volume up/down buttons on each ear! The misguided crusade against buttons has condemned many wireless headphones to unreliable and hard to use touch interfaces and the Powerbeats Pro are fortunately not part of this trend.They're not the best sounding headphones ever, I've used (wired) IEMs that cost less than half what these do and sound better. But you don't buy wireless headphones for audiophile purposes. Audio quality is fine and doesn't actively annoy me, so they pass. There is no built in noise canceling so if you want that you're probably better off with some newer headphones.Battery life is good enough for my purposes. I don't think I've ever actually tested the claimed 9 hours since I prefer full sized headphones for real extended listening, but haven't had issues using for over 5 hours on a single charge. Now, one my biggest issue with these is with the design of the case: even after this long time using the Powerbeats it can be hard to get them to sit in the case properly so that both earbuds charge. It can be a nasty surprise to put your headphones in to charge overnight and discover the next day that one ear is dead instead of charged. You need to check the battery widget on your phone to make sure it indicates both ears are charging, and then be gentle so that the snap of the case closing doesn't knock one of the earbuds loose. As you might have guessed, carrying the case around while charging can be problematic. There are magnets that are supposed to hold the headphones in place but they don't seem to be strong enough to do the job.Now the main reason these are better than other, maybe cheaper wireless headphones is the superior integration with Apple. As someone who hops between iPhone and Android, I can say there's unfortunately no better bluetooth connectivity available than there is between iPhones and headphones with the H1 chip. When I use non-Apple headphones I never feel fully confident taking them out of the case to take an incoming call, because there's a decent chance they either won't connect without fiddling with the Bluetooth menu or the glitchiness of the connection process will drop the call (particularly on Android) or drop me into the call sounding like a robot. With the Powerbeats Pro I don't feel that nervousness grabbing them to take a call. Bluetooth still isn't as reliable as plugging into a headphone jack (remember those?) but iPhone with H1 based headphones is as close as you can get.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2021",AHU6Z4ZEM2QWYMI2YXBXXB7YPZJA,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RLRFWMQOWEANN,B07R5QD598,"4.0 out of 5 stars A short review, if you're trying to decide on buying this...",Kevin S. Goff,4,"I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.I'd give these a ""4 1/2 stars out of five""On the good side:1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone. I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want. Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional. But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.3) As for the fit: these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out). The fit is perfect. (See my notes further down for the ""comfort"")4) I've rarely had problems pairing. I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone. I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.OK, the ""not so good"" side:1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life). You ""can"" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure. Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears ""breathe"".Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5. The three things I mentioned are not ""deal breakers"" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours. As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.Also, there is no ANC. Yes, there's ""noise reduction"" but not cancellation. I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC. However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them. I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking). I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if ""the grass is greener"" with another set. I have to be honest, after buying these, my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.Most reviews I've read are positive on this product. Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive. I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2022",AGPCSSLIATSAHUEUEFPDOK2WLTWQ,TRUE,55,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

When my corded over-ear broke, I really wanted to go completely wireless but feared I would lose them if I did. The over the ear design is perfect for me because standard buds fall out of my ears and feel uncomfortable with some of my ear piercings. These fit nice. They cancel the noise around me perfectly. These are easy to charge and clean. And now with my Apple devices I can find them with a push of a button. The range is wider than before and I can travel substantially further from my phone than I used to with my older Beats, which is important when I’m cleaning outside or upstairs.

The Powerbeats Pro syncs seamlessly with all my Apple devices and sounds fantastic with great separation and bass. They take a bit of time to get the hang of putting them on but with ear hooks, they stay put even during workouts. The Powerbuds are clear when used for phone calls. The case is bulkier than either Samsung earbuds or AirPod Pros but the design with built ear hooks makes them more utilitarian when on the go.

R247P4C3C5EEXY,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Wireless Earbuds - For About 2 Years,Arnold,4,"I don't know if Amazon will list how many times I've purchased these, but this will be my 3rd pair ( 5 if you include the ones that I had to return, 1 was missing the Powerbeats itself and the other had a manufacturing defect ) that I have purchased.The sound of the Powerbeats is great for wireless earbuds and the battery life of both charging case and earbuds are great out of the box! The ear hooks help keep the earbuds in and I don't have to worry about losing one earbud due to it falling out, unlike the Apple Airpods that I keep finding on the ground at work... Having purchased this product a discounted price, I am very satisfied.The only problem I have with this product is the longevity of the batteries of the earbuds and charging case as time passes. After about the 2 year mark, the earbud that is used the most will last about 1-1.5 hours listening to audio and 15 minutes while on a voice call. The lithium ion batteries degrade too rapidly for a product at this price range.Overall, this is a great product, but I wish there was an battery alternative, because even just replacing the batteries at a local electronic repair store is about the same price as brand new Powerbeats at a discount ( approx $150 total to replace the earbud batteries ).","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2024",AEXTQVIKQK72BB6WPCVVUX73H3KQ,TRUE,0,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2QLUHTUKVZ0S4,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars After 3 years…,Digimartyr,4,"I bought these back in 2020, and have been using them ever since. It’s been about a year, but the microphone has degraded and is highly inefficient. It’s amazingly convenient that if you’re listening to music, or just have these in your ear, it’ll pause when you receive a call. You’re then able to press the button to answer. Thing is, the person I’m speaking to would say that I sound muffled and very far away. I’d say in the initial two years that I’ve had these they’ve worked flawlessly. Now I’d have to disconnect from Bluetooth and answer a call as you normally would. It’s very annoying to do when you expect that to be a function of these.Also, when charging the headphones in the case, the nodes on the headphones (or on the case) have degraded to the point where I’d have to keep them pushed down for the connection to be made. It’s a bit frustrating when I forget to do so only to find that one ear has lost power when I thought it was charging the entire time.Otherwise, because they wrap around your ear I’ve NEVER feared them falling out. It hasn’t even been close to coming out when going for a run or going to the gym. They can be cumbersome if you have long hair that covers your ears, but you’ll get use to pushing your hair back to fit them in. I’ve had long hair, and dreads, so trust that that becomes less of an issue as time goes on.Otherwise these perform quite well as headphones on the go. For the bells and whistles of noise cancellation, “aware mode” (being able to hear what’s around you), and top notch sound quality, I leave that to around the ear headphones. It’s of little significance to me with these little things.**EDIT**So, while both headphones are in, the left ears power gets depleted much faster than the left. When checking the power it still reads at least 50%, the right ear being 80%. It’ll then require another charge before working again. So……there’s that too…","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AF4TDDEJFZEQ4TPUNVXBQRRLKM3Q,TRUE,4,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3HL180XQU0CCI,B07R5QD598,3.0 out of 5 stars Powerbeats Pro have a tinny sound and hurt my ears,MikeW,3,"For the price I paid I expected superior sound but the Powerbeats Pro sound tinny with no Bass. After wearing them to the gym for a couple of hours my ears were sore. Sound was superior and fit more comfortable with my old and less expensive Plantronics earbuds which, unfortunately, are no longer made. They did connect and set up on my iPhone very easily but for the price I expected more. I have debated sending them back but I bought the Apple Care with them and don’t want the hassle involved in returning them. I only wear them cycling, running and at the gym so I will probably just live with them. Tried changing the ear tips but it didn’t help with the Bass or comfort. I wouldn’t recommend these.Update to my review of Feb 1, 2023. The left ear bud frequently failed to charge and both earbuds had problems connecting forcing me to go to settings Bluetooth and forget the device and reinstall. Now the earbuds in the case will not connect to my iPhone. I did get AppleCare+ with the earbuds and called tech support but nothing we did would get the earbuds to connect. They are sending a replacement and hopefully it will perform better than the original earbuds. I would not consider purchasing these without the AppleCare extended warranty.Next update: Received my new Powerbeats earbuds and case. At first they charged great, no problem. Now after a month one of earbuds will fail to charge. I have to repeatedly check them to make sure both earbuds are charging. They use magnets to pull the earbuds into place but you still need to push them down to insure the buds are connecting properly to charge. When you close the case often one of the earbuds will lose connection and not charge but will in fact discharge. I constantly get ready to go for a run or to the gym and discover that one esrbud is 100% charged and the other one has no charge or is at 2% or so and will not operate. I then have to try and readjust the discharged earbud in the case and wait for it to charge before going. Annoying to say the least. Also if you sweat while working out, running, etc the contacts will quickly corrode and you have to clean them regularly for them to recharge. Definitely wish I had not purchased these but for the price I paid I can’t afford to just throw them away and buy a different brand. For the next 2 years I guess I will just keep using my AppleCare to return them when they stop working properly.UPDATE: May 15, 2023. Well the left earbud started failing to charge. Cleaned contacts with alcohol using a cotton Q-Tip. Didn’t help. Finally manually reset the charging case and the left earbud started charging though it stalled several times at 50% charged. Finally got the left earbud to charge but have the feeling that these will soon be going back to AppleCare for replacement.UPDATE: July 4, 2023. Left earbud still failing to charge unless I play with it in the case until the red charging light comes on. Then for seemingly no reason it will stop charging and start discharging so that when I go to bed it is charged at 90% but when I get up in the morning to go for my run the right earbud is still fully charged but the left one is now down to 10%. Found out that there is a class action suit being prepared against the Beats Powerbeats pro in several states because of these charging issues Unfortunately Florida is not one of the states in the lawsuit. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE EARBUDS. In the end you will be unhappy if you do.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2023",AE57GQUQQAOW6EK6JFTU6UCBW2HA,TRUE,13,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The other concern was that since they were refurbished, that they could have a malfunctioning problem. They are working properly. I have 3 months to return them if not. They charge super fast, sound quality is very good. However, sometimes people cannot hear me and I have to call them again, or if I am in a poor connection area as well. They are comfortable at the beginning but after a while I need to take them off. But overall, they are best ones so far. Siri asks me if I want to answer the call. I say yes and it connects without having to touch the phone. It reads messages to me from IMessage or WhatsApp. Very cool! I like them a lot. The case loses charge rapidly. Luckily my boyfriend had a spare one and gave it to me, so I can switch and put the other case to charge.

R3J2E3M4YSLALW,B083F7GBP8,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome!!!,happy customer,5,"WONDERFUL ALL AROUND! Thank you!!!COMFORTFor my ear type (medium sized, don’t stick out from my head over an inch rounded out, and a bit narrow) I do not experience any discomfort. Though at first I did feel a small strain.. They seem to have adjusted slightly to my ear.EASE OF USEConnects very quickly. Overall easy to useDESIGNDespite the fact that Apple now owns Beats... unlike AirPods with their much more efficient magnet method of placing the headphones into the case: you may find a 3 second delay in putting the PowerBeats Pro back in the charging case to begin with... I guess you can say it gives your mind a slight workout haha. But you’ll get used to it. 3 seconds is not too long.As far as the actual headphone design...I love the button configuration - makes it very easy to change whatever I am listening to, pause, play, and toggle the volume.I also love the look and aesthetic overall. I personally purchased the ivory color and I am very happy with my choice.Some may not have a liking to the size of the charging case which is honestly pretty bulky and about the size of my palm. Though as mentioned in my recommendation, If you get a case you can have the option of having a small carabiner hook which may help some in carrying it around.REFURBISHEDNo scratches, blemishes, or issues at all. A great way to save an extra few coins if you’d like. Along with the fact that naturally... the normal price for the Power Beat Pros are slightly lower than the commonly compared Airpod Pros.RECOMMENDATIONSAs for any device (phone, tablet, laptop) I would recommend getting a case for them. My last AirPods always found a way to get scratched in my bag or from falling.FAULTSI don’t believe they have a way of tracking hilt into them. If there is I’m unaware of it.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2021",AGWZPG7TASK5BY7IAON7XP6TW36A,TRUE,7,Color: Navy: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R10Q9EC5YQIZ5Y,B083F7GBP8,4.0 out of 5 stars Like new,Chanel,4,"So I got these earbuds because I wanted something that was comfortable and I was getting tired of the overhead earphones so I got these. These were refurbished but they sounded new it knew it took me a few tries to reset them because they would go in-and-out but after I resetted it works perfectly. Except I do have some trouble when I'm connecting to my computer and then the music is fine but then after a while the sound changes. So I disconnected and then I reconnected and then I try to play my music and there is no sound so I have to end up turning my computer off yeast off and then back on again and then reset my beat so once more so that I can re add it to my computer But, they sound great. I like the color I always wanted an ivory pair and the 1st 2 beats that I bought were navy blue and white because because I didn't really look at the color I just pressed by and it wasn't from Amazon it was from another site. But that other site did send me a free pair of headphones because it's because those headphones actually kept going in-and-out so that's why I ended up buying the re furbished ones from Amazon . They sound just like new they they look new and legit I love the case and the case and I love that it can fit In my pocket when I'm traveling especially when I'm walking up to the bus stop so that I can go to work or walking to places where I need to go shopping or just working out the gym or just have it on at work, when I'm off the clock and I'm taking my break.As I speak the beats they are sounding real great but the sound just changed to where it's where it doesn't sound like beat headphones it just sounds like a muffled sound his muffled sound so I had to disconnect them from my computer unpair them and then reset it so that they can work properly and I have to shut down my computer because I try to unconnect them and then reconnect them and I tried to place some sound and nothing was coming out of them but after I shut my computer down and reset it my beats it worked. But that's only for my computer my phone, my smart watch and my tablet they work fine with the beats.","Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2021",AFXLCYWK7ON6Z2B7MRXXDEZXDEXQ,TRUE,8,Color: Navy: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2RSFV9JVG0BN3,B083F7GBP8,1.0 out of 5 stars Terrible Product,Amazon Customer,1,"If you care about sound quality, or your sanity, avoid this item at all costs. I am a Samsung user, owner of a pair of Galaxy Pro Buds 2 which retail for a similar price point. The only thing those earbuds lack is the over the ear clip that is useful while running. These Beats are like a pair of $20 dollar headphones in terms of sound quality and $1 dollar thrift store trash in terms of usability. There is no noise cancelling, there is no active pass through, the free wired headphones that come with my phone sounds 100x better by comparison. I cannot believe Apple would attach their name to such an awful product. Not only are you forced to use a proprietary charging cable, the item may or may not charge both ear buds at the same time leaving you with one 100% and one 0% when you're ready to use them. When they do charge together, you'll probably have to re-pair the Bluetooth device each time. The last time I did this, the name of the device changed to a series of unintelligible characters in my phone that looked like I had been taken over by Chinese malware. Once the device has been paired, I experienced audio playing out of sync simultaneously making the experience quite nauseating to listen to. To remedy this, I used only one earbud to avoid having to listen to competing audio syncs, only to experience audio cutting out every 7 seconds in the one remaining bud which reminded me of a skipping CD as I listened to streaming audio. At the end of my last run, I contemplated smashing them into a million pieces with a hammer just to make sure no one else would ever have to go through the same experience, but I'm returning them instead. 10/10 would never buy again, or any apple product for that matter. This is one of the only reviews I've ever been motivated to write because the experience was so poor. I'm offended on a cellular level by these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AHMFSVJVHYWLO32VCJN63DGBAHIA,TRUE,3,Color: Navy: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2F0A5B805CZRR,B083F7GBP8,4.0 out of 5 stars They sound great but…,michayla,4,They came in their box packaged like they were new and it looked promising at first. I looked at them with a flashlight out of the box and there was makeup on both earbuds and this small black dust residue on one of them that smudged when i took it off. Weirdly enough they seemed to have glitter on them too? I was easily able to remove all of it quickly and easily and it was fine. I totally understand that refurbished/renewed might mean they have some cosmetic things but this was disappointing. I imagine if someone spent more than 5 minute “renewing” these they would’ve wiped that off…. Disappointing. What matters though—they sounded really great and fit in my ears well but I’m still returning because I don’t really have confidence that these were actually “renewed”.

R1JWJ95BYVWRD0,B0BZK2Z2TC,"5.0 out of 5 stars An alternative to AirPod Pros? Yes, but with a slight lower quality difference. Worth it? Yes",Matthew Martínez,5,"I compared these beats with AirPod pros. Both are Apple products.The beats have a smaller range of volume, the lowest volume is pretty loud for the “lowest volume”. Each level for volume going up is minimal compared to the AirPods. (At around 1/3 of the volume they match volume. AirPods get a lot quieter and ALOT louder, I’d say 10% louder) The beats are loud enough for me I leave it at 3/4 of volume.Noise cancellation is really good, some noise filters through in loud environments but it’s enough when you’re at the gym and busy places. I experienced noise filtering through when I was in a car with music blasting. So I’d rate the noise cancellation pretty high.Pass through, pass through is good. I’d recommend not having the pass through when there’s lots of noise cause it’s good and personally it can get loud. When there’s a sudden loud noise the earbuds make the same loud noise and it could hurt your ears if you have sensitive hearing.Cons, when in loud environments if you are on a call the earbuds filter out the noise, and when you speak it filters your voice a bit too which makes it hard for the other person on the other end to hear you. Also the bit about the loud noise with the pass through and sensitive ears is a con for me.Battery life is really good, lasts me my work day and a bit more, I’m sure like all batteries that would go down after use but hasn’t happened to me yet I’ve had it for 2 months now.Bluetooth, the Bluetooth is pretty strong. You could probably still have a connection a few rooms away in a house before the connection begins to fail. Unlike AirPods when you remove the bud from an ear whatever is playing will not pause unless YOU pause it. This means it’s constantly connected, when you are within the Bluetooth radius of course. I’ve lost a bud twice but this actually helped me find it, so that’s a plus. And with these beats you cannot connect another pair to your phone like you can with AirPods. So it’s only on pair of beats at a time.I really like the earbuds and I think they are well worth the price, to me they are a barely lesser version of AirPod pros. I’m considering getting the studio pro’s over the AirPod max after this experience.Update 4 months later- The battery life is still very strong, I have had some issues with them disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone and I believe it’s because when I got my Apple Watch, it must be Confusing the connection between my phone and the watch. Yes, it can be annoying but to me, it’s still worth it. All really need to do is reconnect with my phone. I don’t think AirPods Will have this problem. But I’m not sure. There was one day where the noise cancellation on my right earbud stopped working, but it’s because I didn’t have enough battery so I had to charge it after that I had no issues.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AFPNLCKHE6UN5JN6M77MOHLXXGGA,TRUE,49,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R2BD35HL2C6JSK,B0BZK2Z2TC,5.0 out of 5 stars Read this Review (I'll tell you why I settled on these after researching for months!),Tuck VB,5,"You're probably like me, dragging your feet for months, researching and researching for hours trying to compare brand names (Bose, or JBL? Sennheiser, or Apple?). I finally settled on these, and here's why:1) I didn't want airpods. You probably also don't want airpods (if you're even reading this review). Not because of the quality, but because ""everyone has airpods"" and they're ""airpod people"" (sorry to all the airpod people, including my sister). I wanted to be different (hopefully no shame there?).2) My top priority was phone calls with my earbuds (make sure, even if you don't end up with these earbuds, that you determine your priorities, -clearly-). These earbuds have some of the best ""in ear"" calling I've seen (next to airpods).3) I wanted something low profile (also why I didn't want airpods with the ""stem""). These are very sleek, and don't look flashy in the ear. They're also not very cumbersome, and fit very snuggly. Very light, but durable - great design, even better build quality.4) Not a huge selling factor for me personally, but if you want noise cancellation, this is your stop. I just used these this morning on the train coming into Boston, sitting next to the door leading out of the coach, and was astonished with how adaptive it was to specifically tuning out the rattling of the train. These earbuds will adapt to the environments around them!5) The battery life is fantastic. Keep in mind, if you're in a loud area with the noise cancelling on, and it's working harder, you're going to blow through your battery faster - even that considered, I was still really impressed with the battery life!6) This is clearly designed to work seamlessly with Apple products. Pairing was a breeze, and the connectivity is strong. Beats and Apple had a beautiful handshake with this product, and it shows.7) Lastly, the sound quality. This is unmatched with anything I've used prior. Has very clear audio, and a great range of tone. The bass is powerful, while balancing defined treble tones.A couple things to consider:-These don't have wireless charging (unlike my other gadgets). I need to plug them into USB-C to charge. Might not be a big deal for you, but this is a drawback on my radar.-Get a protective case! The existing charging case is well built, and sturdy - but if you're like me, and you put your phone in a protective case, do the same for your earbuds. The case I got was drop proof, and didn't add much to the size (it doesn't take up much space in my pocket). It was $10 for peace of mind. Get an airtag too while you're at it!Overall, would recommend!","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AFYYCTAQAUEWFDXYF7BHMXS66TJQ,TRUE,172,Color: Black/GoldStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

R13FS9E750HR39,B0BZK2Z2TC,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Daily Use,IT Guy,4,"The media could not be loaded. Quick OverviewI bought these headphones to replace some other earbuds that were beginning to have issues and so far I have really enjoyed these headphones. Since these earbuds are made with Apple in mind, they have easy pairing just like Airpods. They also integrate with Siri to read your texts and notifications, etc. and give you a chance to respond which is a great feature I missed when using another brand. My only complaint at the moment is really just a minor inconvenience - because of the low profile of the earbuds they are harder to grab out of the case since only a few millimeters of the earbuds are sticking out to grab. If you have nails or bigger fingers you might find it annoying to grab out of the case.One of my favorite things about these earbuds is the fact that they have actual physical buttons, NOT have touch buttons. I wear hoodies and it’s so annoying when it brushes a touch button and pauses my music or turns noise cancelling on or off.Crisp and Clear Sound Quality:The sound quality is impressive across various genres of music. The earbuds deliver a well-balanced sound signature with clear vocals, detailed instrument separation, and a mostly satisfying bass response. The highs are crisp, without being harsh, and the mids are well-presented. The bass isn't as punchy as I would like, but with how small these earbuds are that is kind of to be expected. It does provides a good level of depth without overpowering the other frequencies, but if you like a lot of bass these might not be for you. Overall, the sound quality of will please most casual listeners alike and even some music enthusiasts. These earbuds lack customizable EQ settings. This may not be a big deal to some people, but I like to adjust the bass and the highs depending on the genre of music I am listening to.Comfortable and Secure Fit:These earbuds are designed with user comfort in mind. They come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a secure fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight and ergonomic design make them comfortable to wear. I've worn them for about 4 hours at a time and will sometimes forget they are there. Personally the Airpods didn't fit in my ear as well and these stay in better for me.Great Noise Cancellation:I prefer active noise cancellation because the fit of passive noise cancellation is usually less comfortable. These earbuds have a solid fit and use active noise cancellation which I prefer - and is pretty impressive. Typically I like to hear my environment when walking my dogs but the noise cancellation is so good I have to turn it off. I could keep noise cancellation on with my old headphones and it really just reduced how loud the noise was. This is also really helpful when I am on a call and my dogs are in the other room. I usually have to keep muting my mic because my dogs are barking, but when testing my girlfriend couldn't hear the dogs while we were on the phone.Incredibly Stable Bluetooth Connection:The connection between these earbuds and my phone is absolutely incredible. Bluetooth connection quality can vary quite a bit but these have one of the most stable and reliable connections that I have ever seen with wireless earbuds. There is virtually no latency. I left my phone in my bedroom and walked about 100 feet and went outside into the backyard and close the door. There wasn't even a stutter with the connection. Amazing.Battery Life:There is always a claim of an impressive battery life with high end earbuds. I haven't had a chance to test yet, but I plan to drain the battery completely on the earbuds and the case and track how long it takes to charge, how long the earbud batteries last, and how long the case battery lasts. I will update this review once I have had a chance to test!Overall the Beats Studio + offer a great audio experience and sound quality, comfortable fit, and amazing wireless connection. While there are a few minor inconveniences, none of them are dealbreakers and these earbuds are a great choice for anyone seeking a good pair of wireless earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AGYDMBJ7K2SRHYL7DHHL37MLHDUQ,TRUE,190,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

R32J1YNX3NHKAE,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Thoroughly disappointed.,atomsk,3,"After having these for some time, I hate to say that I am thoroughly disappointed in them. I bought these to replace my trusty Bose QuietComfort Limited Editions that I’d had for maybe four years. Loved them. They died, and I wasn’t mad because they’d lasted through sweat, rain, dust, etc. Searched and searched for a replacement, bought these as I’d had good experiences with Beats products before. Total. Letdown. The audio quality is okay, but the noise cancellation is temperamental. Battery life is good, charging is good, but that’s about it. The fit is sketchy. They actually fall out of my ears when I sweat. I expect any earbuds to loosen or slip a bit, given my large, odd ears. These, actually fall out. I cannot get the fit to stay good, no matter what size cups I use. And the connectivity is bad. They routinely stop playing sound at random, and can only be restarted from my phone (which is an iPhone) and not from the buttons on the actual earbuds. They disconnect completely sometimes, too. Everything is updated, my device and the earbuds, still lackluster performance.

RWUFM677B047O,B0BZK2Z2TC,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best out there but...,Honest Reviewer Zach,5,"This is hands down one of the best earbuds in the world period. Some cons that I've noticed after using them are.Cons:-The left earbud has low static sound when nothing is playing.-The earbuds pick up a ton of background noise with their microphones. But it's normal.-Note that it's impossible to speak to someone on the phone while, for example you're at a pretty loud gym.-Putting one earbud into the case, pauses whatever you're playing from your phone.-I personally never use transparency mode. However, when putting one earbud into the case, it always switches to transparency mode, and you have to manually change it on the app. The app doesn't allow to set default modes.Pros:-They are build very strong, and earbuds wouldn't come apart and break even if you step on them.-Earbuds are able to connect/link to two devices at the same time and switch between them seamlessly. Few earbuds have this capability if any.-Additionally, earbuds are able to link to your Google account and connect to devices much easier.Overall, very good noise cancellation, sound quality, decent bass, battery life, charging speed, design, feel, and look.Two month update: Sometimes the system notifications get messed up - it notifies you about the percentage of the case and both earbuds every 5 seconds. Sometimes one of the earbuds goes out, without a low battery warning. Putting them into a case for a few seconds fixes this. Also sometimes the noise cancelling gets messed up - it does the exact opposite - adds noise. Again putting both of the earbuds for a couple of seconds into the case fixes this.Six month update:I had to send this product for repair (directly to apple) tree times before all issues were fixed. The first two times, it was free, but the third time I had to pay $84 for them to get fixed.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AELKL63BZ7XFD27KO3R6BEVSDWRA,TRUE,68,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R5M5AUQEOJMSM,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones with frustrating bug with iPhone,Laura G,3,"I like these headphones but there are some serious issues if you use these with an iPhone. Apple has owned Beats for a decade and when connected to Apple products, have a specific menu to control their functionality. I have a fully updated iPhone 11 Pro. Though it's not the newest phone, I should have to have the newest phone to use Apple-supported headphones.Pros:• I can switch between my phone, my iPad, and Macbook pretty easily. I don't have to forget my headphones on one thing in order to connect to another.• The sound quality is pretty good.• They stay in my ears well.• The physical button to pause or skip works well and has a nice feel.• Control of settings like listening mode and button function are in settings on the iOS or Mac OS without needing a third-party app or toggling manually through features on the headphones themselves.• When noise cancelling and transparent modes work, they work pretty well (see cons).Cons:• From day 1, these have had problems staying connected to my iPhone. If I pause or don't have audio playing for a short period of time (usually around 30 seconds though it's happened after about 15 seconds), the headphones disconnect. They will then attempt to reconnect but with no sound. You have to go into Bluetooth settings, disconnect the headphones, wait, and then reconnect. This is when the screen is active and being used, so it can't be blamed on the iOS going into a sleep mode or because the screen is dark. It happens on a daily basis if I pause to talk to someone or if I'm taking a moment to select my next song or YouTube video. Apple Support is no help as their solution is to forget the headphones and re-add them. This fixes the problem for less than a day. I don't have the issue if I'm connected to my laptop or iPad. Yes, my iOS is fully updated and yes, the headphones are fully charged. Again, this has been since I opened them and started using them.• After six months of use, the left earbud has an on and off thumping when I'm in noise cancelling or transparent mode. It's so bad, I've just resigned myself to not using either mode unless I have to.• No wireless charging option. This might be due to Apple proprietary tech, but it's still a con.• Approximately every two or three weeks, I can't change the noise cancelling settings because my phone thinks both headphones are out of the case (you can't use noise cancelling or transparent mode with one earbud). I would have to turn my phone off and restart it to get the modes to work again.Overall, the headache these headphones cause is not worth the convenience of their auto compatibility with Apple products or their sound quality. Apple needs to look into the bugs for iPhone and not brush them off. Won't be buying again and I'm looking for a new alternative to Apple Airpods.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AGX7ZX53ATOLBXKS3QMWZIUUG4AQ,TRUE,16,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I have tried different size cushions and it did help some but there are times when I don’t have my hands free and they start to slip out. Very frustrating. I have 1 more complaint and it may just be me but people have a hard time hearing me when I take a call with them on. 90% of the time I have to take them out to finish my conversation.LoveOn a positive note the battery life is really good. They send out 2-3 warning alerts to let you know the batteries are nearing the end of their life. it’s great because it gives you plenty of time before your cut off. If your like me and only wear 1 at a time, the alerts gives you lots of time to switch out to the other bud before your cut off.I also love the noise canceling feature but if you don’t love it there is actually a setting that lets you turn it off.

RR59V1YTAKMN3,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Be aware if you are an AirPods user...,P. Liu,3,"For me, the battery life at around 75% volume is around 7h50m with ANC and Transparency set to Off. The sound quality, and I've owned several HiFi headsets including HiFiMan and Sennheiser's, is nothing ground breaking or it's just typical Beats. So it's okay if you know the Beats sound. For my ears, the default plugs works fine and doesn't appear to fall out.So, several things to note:1) it Does Not automatically switch sources on Apple platforms like AirPods does(you have to manually switch)! It does, however, pair once and connects to all of your devices under the same Apple ID. So it sits somewhere in between the traditional BT headset and an AirPods.2) The case is wider than AirPods Pro case by more than ~1/2"" and taller by ~1/4""... So, kinda big but pocketable.3) For reasons unclear to me, mine unit charges to 98-99%... Not sure what's causing that4) No iOS 'Fit Test' for these buds... So choosing the right plug is your call!5) One reason I'm debugging and still might return the item: On a phone call or FaceTime call, at some point in the call, the other person can not hear my voice until I switch back to either Speaker or iPhone. The little Googling I did suggest that I'm not alone in this, and switching to Speaker then Back to the Buds might recover the microphone. But it's unacceptable for my sound to drop out on a call and not knowing it's happening until the other parties mentioned it. Until I can resolve this, I won't be doing any phone calls or using the microphones on this thing... Unresolved, I will return it!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AF5USDTPPMDQCVOELHMZTQMMA42Q,TRUE,1,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I appreciate the attempt to make a product more buyer accessible than their powerbeats pro/fit (which at this point are simply overpriced). That said, these buds+ are lackluster at just about everything except listening to audio in quiet-moderately loud environments.Pros: They fit well enough, stay in ear, and are comfortable enough that i often walk into meetings forgetting that I have them in (and then end up yelling a bit do to the anc dulling).Cons: These are absolutely terrible for phone and video calls (facetime, whatsapp, Teams, Zoom, etc). Multiple chats have resulted in me giving up and using my gym headphones or the built in speaker. If these weren't a gift, i'd be upset as travel/in office is my main use case. IYou're better off buying airpods if you want something all around. OR pay more for the powerbeats or Sony buds (could be others that are solid but those are the two i can directly speak to). If you just want decent quality audio for at home or travel, then I suggest you get these on a sale and don't pay more than ~$90 for them.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AEDYCUQ5SNLQNTZFGDXQMFM2UMEQ,TRUE,1,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I asked around at work and it was a tie between these and the second gen airpods pro for popularity. Having an android phone, I knew that if I went with the airpods again, all the headache that would come with using them with an android phone, so I bought the beats studio buds +. Despite having one of the longest names in beats history, these buds have just as long of a battery, claiming nine hours on a charge, which when using them during 12 hour work shifts, I can attest to being true and then some. As someone who has never liked noise cancelling headphones, I actually really enjoy these, especially when on a bus or a plane, they make a huge difference. The sound quality is sharp and clean, and the bass is not overpowering, but still quite noticeable, using the same tricks as the airpods pro. This shouldn't be a surprise because these use the same chip as the airpods family of headphones, so they work great on iPhone, but just as well on android.Pairing is simple and controlled using an app (on Android), which allows all control that would normally be found in iPhone settings","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AHQOAZEU53L72SUQOALTM7EC3YKQ,TRUE,2,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

The sound quality is good for the price. Scale of 1 to 10. Bass is 7 and Treble is 8. Sound is crisp with no interference or background hiss. Bluetooth is strong, comparable to AirPods if not slightly better. Only drawback is the earbud housing material is slick plastic making it an effort to remove from the case especially in cold weather when the fingers are dry.

These are immersive buds. I could hear every individual instrument, clearly. I’m kind of amazed there is no eq function or an app of any sort. Not really needed or a deal breaker but I like to tinker.are they worth $170? Hell no and I’d expect to see a drop in price m, very soon. But for the price I got them at, a little over a hundred in good, used condition, these are the best in that class. If you can find these for $130 and under, do it. Otherwise there are better premium options out there. Good but not great battery. If you’re planning on using them for more than four hours, you might have an issue.

R3QICTPBYDSHG,B0BZK2Z2TC,"3.0 out of 5 stars So far, so good except that mics don't work reliably",J. Mcdaniel,3,"I've been using these for about 3 weeks and have been very happy with their functionality and feel. In my uploaded picture, you'll see a little black ""mustache"" / lip protrusion that I added using electrical tape because I found myself always hunting to find the lid's edge when I went to open the case. (Like the way you ""hunt"" for the right way to insert a USB cable. 🙂) This feature improved usability for me and I'm mentioning here in case the manufacturer has anyone reading these reviews for future improvements.I like how you can use the app to customize behavior /settings of the earbuds, and really like how if you leave one inserted, it can (with the right settings) use amplification to make it so you're hearing normally, as though nothing is blocking your ear canal.I was used to other earbuds that were capacitive touch and wanted to point out that these are tactile touch, meaning you need to push the surface of the earbud to click the button. You'll feel a little click when it works each time but it's barely perceptible and not annoying.The only problem I had and ultimately had to return them is that I routinely had feedback on calls that the mics were inconsistently picking up my voice.","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2024",AFEHMC3NEQ5CJN4XTMXZZBK7NPCQ,TRUE,5,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R3ACA4BFELO1SS,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Apple/Beats is walking a middle line with these,This Is Not,3,"I've been using these the last couple of days as my everyday drivers. I have tried Beats earbuds before, mainly the Studio Buds and the Studio Buds+. Neither stayed in my ears without relying on foam ear tips. So, I never fully switched to them and returned them for other products. I have a pair of old PowerBeats Pro, but I stopped using them a while back because they don't have ANC and rely on Lightning for charging (which should be a sin in 2024). I've always wanted to like the Studio Buds and Buds+ due to their design and overall solid build, but they never stayed in my ears.The same holds true with the Solo Buds. They're just like the Studio Buds+, just a little smaller and lighter. If the Studio Buds/Buds+ didn't stay in your ears, these ones won't either. I went through all the different ear tip sizes and medium fit me the best, but I had to push the right earbud back into my ear every hour or so.While I had these in my ears, I was able to do some listening. They popped up on my iPhone 15 Pro Max like all other Beats and Apple earbuds/headphones. You get some options in the iOS settings and the drop down menu. Unlike AirPods, these do not feature head tracking for spatial audio (though they do work with spatial audio, so does ANY pair of earbuds or headphones) or any ANC whatsoever. The charging case does not have a battery in it either. These earbuds last for about 17 hours (Apple advertises 18 hours) when I listened to them at about 75% volume.One thing that took me back was just how quiet these were. I had the same issue with the Studio Buds+. I have Soundcheck turned on in Apple Music due to listening to Atmos/Spatial tracks. It turns up their volume to match the volume of other tracks in my library while normalizing track volumes across the board. Still, I have other earbuds and headphones from Sony, Moondrop, and Heavys that don't require my iPhone's volume set to 75% for comfortable listening.Although the battery life is exceptional, charging these is a pain. Like I said, the case doesn't have a battery in it which means you need to be near a power source to recharge these. The case doesn't have a charging indicator light, so you don't know the charging state of the earbuds. Are they full, half, or somewhere between? I don't know, you need to lift their lid to find out. The bottom of the case is flat, just like Sony's case for their WF-1000XM5 earbuds (my everyday pair after I test others). It works for Sony because the case supports Qi charging. The Solo Buds case is begging to have a Qi charger in it. That would have helped immensely with the charging situation. Plop them on a Qi charger with an indicator light and wait for it to turn off. At least then you could tell when the earbuds were fully charged.But nope, Apple cut corners here and the case's only purpose is to take power from the back USB-C port and pipe it to the prongs connecting to the earbuds.Overall, the sound quality is fine, albeit very generic. Bass isn't boosted, neither are trebles. I would say this is a slight V-shaped curve, but not much. People expecting a bass boosted profile should know that these fit in the current Beats sound signature of things being flatter and more accurate. It's a little baffling given the history of Beats and that most people, especially those buying mainstream audio products, like a V-shaped sound signature with boosted lows and highs.I listened to modern pop, some metal, hard rock, and dubstep. It all sounded fine. Details were there, but not as much as my Sony WF-1000XM5. But I expected that given the price difference between these and the Sony earbuds (they MSRP for over 4X as much). There isn't wear detection or anything else fancy. Microphone quality is fine, it works but they do let in more outside noise than I'm used to. There isn't any special microphone noise cancelling like with other earbuds. If there is, I'm not hearing it.The biggest reason why I gave these 3 stars and not more is because, compared to other earbuds, these are far too expensive and should be in the $30 price range. Take the Soundcore A40 earbuds. They MSRP for $80 but are routinely on sale for $60 (sometimes even $50). They have less battery life, ""only"" 10 hours compared to 18. But that 10 hour battery life is while using ANC. It isn't the best ANC, but it's ANC nonetheless and that's something the Solo Buds do not have.The Soundcore A40 also have a companion app letting you adjust the EQ to your liking. It isn't an advanced EQ, but it's better than nothing and I think they sound much better than the Solo Buds. They aren't as quite and my iPhone sits at about 40-50% volume instead of 75% for comfortable listening (not even loud listening). The Soundcore A40 have a case featuring a battery and you can recharge the earbuds 4 more times. Their case also features Qi and USB-C charging with an indicator light. You know the rough battery percentage for the earbuds without popping the lid open. You can place the A40 case on a Qi charger and it will recharge both the case and earbuds without issues.For $20 less (right now), you can get a much better pair of earbuds from Soundcore/Anker that have more features and better sound quality. They don't have a fancy animation when you open them next to your iPhone or Android phone, but you get so much more out of them.Honestly, if Apple put a $30 price sticker on these, I would fully recommend them. You're getting neutral sounding earbuds with some smart features (mainly pairing and automatic spatial audio on iPhones). For $30, it's fine to miss a few features like wear detection and the lack of a battery in the charging case. But, at their current full MSRP (or even down to $50), these just aren't worth it, not for the compromises. If you really need to stick with the Beats brand, I think the Beats Flex are a better buy because they include an Apple chip (better iPhone compatibility) and you can put wing tips on them without ruining their compatibility with a charging case.I've also found the microphone quality to be better with the Beats Flex, it's probably because the microphone is closer to your mouth. I also think the Beats Flex sound better. They're still missing tons of smart features, but they're also often available for $50. They also have a charging indicator light.Honestly, I'm not sure what Apple was thinking with these at their full MSRP. You're paying for a little popup on your iPhone/Android and the Beats name, nothing more. Save money and go with Soundcore/Anker for better earbuds and an overall better package. Either that or, if you really want Beats, get the Beats Flex or wait for these to drop down to $35. They aren't worth more than that.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHIDDYIZWNSZJVM4NNK5Y3ISPKAQ,FALSE,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

Beats are known to be particularly good for bass-heavy music; I have a pair of Beats over ear headphones and they are decent. These earbuds however do not live up to the reputation.Pros:* I was excited to see how small the case is for these earphones. It is significantly smaller and lighter than the typical Apple airpods case, for example. I ordered in the translucent red and it is a cool look. I like being able to see the electronics within the case (the buds are solid color red).* the form factor and related design of the buds is excellent. They are covered in a rubberized material typical for sports electronics, making them water and sweat resistant as well as mostly impervious to dirt. the fit in the ear is really good, and they come with multiple sets of ear tips in matching color. They do not fall out of my ear despite use during sports / exercise.* sound quality for phone use is very good. I can hear well and callers can hear me. They hold up to reasonable background noise.* sound quality for podcasts and other spoken word is also good. I can hear clearly and volume is sufficient.* iphone integration is decent. The earbud controls appear on iphone in a similar fashion to airpods.* battery life is good. I would estimate 10-12 hrs on a single charge.* they come with a 1-year warrranty from Apple (as documented in the product guide)Cons:*sound quality with music is only so-so. I was frankly disapointed. They do not hold up well in an A-B comparison with my Apple Airpod Pros (2nd generation) - a decent Mid-Fi option. In my opinion these are unsuitable for listening to music.* no case battery. The reason the case is so much smaller is because the case itself cannot charge the ear buds without being plugged in. I guess this is ok since the battery life on the ear buds is very good compared with others, but it was a surprise to me.* missing my favorite airpod feature - automatic pause. On my airpods, if I take one out of my ear the source pauses.

While they may lack a battery within the case, reducing the overall listening time, the buds themselves offer an **excellent battery life**. In testing, they lasted just shy of **17.5 hours**, though individual results may vary slightly. Their portability is a significant advantage, making them a convenient choice for on-the-go music enthusiasts.It's true, the absence of an **IP rating** for water and sweat resistance, along with the lack of noise canceling or spatial audio features, might be seen as downsides. However, these omissions are somewhat mitigated by the buds' affordability. The removal of the indicator light, a seemingly small feature we've all come to rely on, is a curious choice by Apple. It's akin to a phone without a camera; it functions, but something feels amiss. Now, users must rely on their phones to check the battery life and confirm if the charging cable is properly connected. For iPhone users, this information is conveniently displayed via an on-screen card, while Android users can find it in the app.Despite these quirks, the Beats Solo Buds strike a balance between **size, sound quality, and price** that many will find just right. For those seeking alternatives, the Soundcore Space A40 offers a similar size, more overall battery life, a wireless charging case, and comparable sound quality with a bit more sub-bass impact. They also boast a comfortable fit with ANC and an actual **IPX4 rating**, all at a price point that's often under $50 on sale, available in black, blue, and white—all of which are quite stylish.

They represent Beats' approach to minimalist function, design, but kind of miss the mark.These buds are small.

R3KI9GNXUTY8X4,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't live up to the brand name,Cheesy,3,"TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality. Expensive.Beats has really made a name for itself as a brand and is considered a higher end option for sound. When I received this pair of earbuds, my impression was that it sounds the same as my skullcandy buds... For a brand that advertises itself as being a first choice for music buffs who are invested in quality sound, I couldn't tell much of a difference. There is no EQ setting to tinker with in an app like I've seen in some other earbuds that market themselves as musically superior. In fact, the Beats app seems to only exist to show you adds for more Beats.But, I am not picky about my earbuds. I usually pick based on pricing, comfort, and convenience over sound quality. That being said, these buds fit in the ear much easier AND more comfortably than the skullcandy ones I've used in the past. They are extremely comfortable and do not fall out. The case (transparent red) is very attractive and slim and the lid doesn't fly open accidentally to make you risk losing a bud.Ultimately, they are better than previous earbuds I've used, but only in comfort and fit, not in sound. I don't know if I'd shell out an extra $40 for these just for a more comfortable fit vs. the $39.99 competitor.TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality.

I can listen to podcasts or music and this thing is loud enough to hear even when I'm hammering. My only real complaint is that the bass is very punchy, sometimes overshadowing highs and midrange. There are two programed equalizer settings, one of which will abate some of that bass. The best thing about this speaker is that it is built like a tank. The tweeters on the ends are well protected by polycarbonate guards. It looks like it could survive a drop of several feet onto concrete, which is great for use in my forging area so if I knock it off my worktable, it should hold up. It also comes packed with extra features and is slightly weatherproof.

The only thin I wish is that it had its own more powerful ac adapter to make it change he faster. It only has what I this is a usb-c plug to attaché to a phone or tablet charger you already have. It has only two eq settings. One for a slightly lower volume with more bass but sacrifices a more clean sound, and a brighter setting with more midrange and highs. Enough with this review.

I bought this speaker so we could have music for ourselves and the runners. It fit the bill because it wasn't too expensive, seemed rugged and boasted good battery life. I wasn't sure if it would be loud enough outside, particularly when I realized the meet up spot was right next to the freeway. However, the speaker did great. Of course it wasn't professional loud, but it was pretty darn loud. Good enough for our spontaneous, unofficial aid/cheer station. And the quality of the sound was awesome. I played it at full volume for 2.5 hours without any problems. I plan to buy a second one and link them up for twice the volume at the next marathon we cheer at.

Can barely keep charging and playing music when on full blast, unplug the charger on accident and I’ve got minutes to plug the charger back in before the radio dies again. They choose an awful charging cable type, if the radio falls on its back with the charger plugged in, the charger head on the cable would snap inside the radio, then I’d have to buy another $25 charging cable. Dropped a couple times and the bass sounds like garbage. Sounds like how my base model Chevy Cobalt’s stock sound system was when I turned it up full blast, like a blown subwoofer maybe? Can’t even put a podcast on because it puts bass when the people are speaking. Low battery warning doesn’t play on full blast, so I can’t even hear the radio when it says low battery. Brought this when my $60 Walmart party speaker died on me after 2 years, but that thing was more bang for my buck than this radio that lasted maybe 3-4 months.

That is probably what this is designed for, outdoor gatherings or pool-side use. For the price, it is a very good deal for that purpose. I will probably give it 5 stars for outdoor use.The main issue is the sound quality. It sounds good, but definitely not refined. Compare it next to your home stereo and you will find out. The sound is a bit unnatural, high is sharp, low sounds artificial and voice is not very clear either. With ""EQ"" mode on, it is a bit more balanced. Admittedly, sound quality is subjective and this is a relatively small speaker. Giving it covers quite good frequency range, it may suit certain music genre.

Overall, really solid for what you're paying.But, two things it does that really bother me:1. I often use it very stop and go as I listen to music while I'm working and have to pause frequently. Half the time the speaker is on but audio is paused, it has this super high frequency tone that's insufferable. It's the kind of high frequency noise that might not affect you if you're over a certain age, but it drives me insane. Not a problem when music is playing though, only when it is on standby.2. It does this weird thing where sometimes when I connect it to my phone while music is already playing, it shoots the volume all the way up. Maybe this is an iphone thing, but I've used so many similar blutooth speakers over the years and never encountered this. It's really jarring everytime it happens. I've leared to stop my music before connecting and re-adjust the volume, as it will often default to max volume.Those may seem like pretty notable complaints, but this is half the price of other similar quality waterproof blutooth speakers, so you get what you pay for and for that - seems fair enough to me.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2024",AE4COSQSJ4SIM4YPS4MRZENNFYXQ,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Speaker

We took it to the beach multiple times.I missed having a small speaker at work (I'm not a huge ear bud fan even though I have a set of Galaxy buds) so when I saw this speaker with a $4 coupon I said 'why not'. This 'improved' version sounds great, it's very portable, and I like that there's not a cover flap on the sides for the connection ports like the Soundcore 2 has. This version shows it only has about 6w of power compared to the 12w the Soundcore 2 has, but I really can't tell a difference. The only negative I have is the micro USB cable- why can't everything be USB-C these days?I really like Anker products- I have a bunch of their rechargeable flashlights and the Soundcore Rave+ speaker, which is huge and is our primary outdoor sound system.For the price you can't beat this little bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2024",AF4KYB3KGUI7XKEPOUVW6FDOR6AQ,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Speaker

It serves pretty well, but spoken words and the recordings of older programs could use all the help possible to hear as much crispness as possible. Music is quite enjoyable from such a small device, but speech clarity is sometimes muddled.Lastly, I would have preferred the power cord, which I personally prefer to leave connected as much as I can, wold enter at the rear of the box while the controls remain on the ends and top. And, if the functions could be highlighted rather than only felt, my options for speaker placement would be expanded.

It starts quickly, connects easily, and works like you would expect. I've used it with my iPhone XS and my MS Surface Book, with little-to-no issues. The battery lasts a respectable amount of time, and it charges from 25% to full in about 3 hours or so.In addition to playing music, I've also used it for teleconference calls (iPhone, MS Teams, Zoom, etc.). The sound is more than adequate, and the microphone seems to work just find for anyone sitting around a small table to be heard on the other end.It does feel quite heavy and generally well built - probably a little more bulk than you'd want for something to throw in a backpack.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2021",AGO5U427URUWN65GLUIZHLNY6HWQ,TRUE,20,Color: Black
R2RZ6W43OGMY3S,B07PMBCTSY,1.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker while it lasted,Knucklehead,1,"Update (April 29th, 2022)Coming in at almost two months since my original review of this speaker, my second one has now started to have the horrendous static/scratching audio issue. My wife and I were using it tonight, listening to an audiobook when the speaker cut out for a split second and then came back to regular volume but with a horrible static noise behind the narrator. I paused the audiobook, turned the speaker off and then back on, and then tested some music. As I had expected and even stated in my original portion of the review, this one finally kicked the bucket. It's unfortunate, considering the price of these speakers. I have now downgraded my overall rating to 1 star (if I could give zero, I would). I don't know if I'll be using this company's products anymore which is unfortunate because they make some really solid products while they last.Original ReviewI recently owned two different earlier versions of this companies speakers and I enjoyed both of those, so when I saw there was another upgraded model, I had to get it. I got two of these speakers a little over six months ago and they had been great the entire time I had them; the sound quality was awesome, the lights were always a pleasure to have on but a minor complaint is that the battery life was a bit of an issue, but I can understand why as the bass boost and the lights probably drained the battery much faster.I kept one at home and the other I kept at work to use during my workdays. The work one got anywhere between 4-6 hours of use every other day or so over the last six months and it held up quite well until just last week when suddenly during a podcast the audio began to crackle. Within a couple more minutes, it was to the point that it was drowning out the podcast entirely and the speaker was rendered useless. I don't know what could've caused this as I'm very particular about my items: when I wasn't at work, the speaker was locked away in my toolbox in a dry location. Since I work at a solitary station, nobody outside of a supervisor comes to my workstation so it wasn't damaged by a careless co-worker. But then I came on here and saw that this seems to be an issue that others have run into as well. The only difference I've noticed is that mine lasted quite a long while compared to what others have said (like I said, it literally just passed the six month mark of owning it). It's unfortunate because now it makes me wonder how much longer my other one is going to last for, which is why I have it at a 2 star. I was gonna go with 3 stars but with the knowledge that this one will more than likely inevitably come to this same fate, I can't bring myself to rate it any higher even with the positives.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2022",AF4HRZTTXFWGTVFOLHBMWTKBZFGA,TRUE,2,Color: Black

I had never heard of this brand before, but needed a bluetooth speaker quickly and on a budget.The speaker came in packaged very well. It comes with an aux cable so you can hard wire it to a computer or phone if you don't want to use the bluetooth. It also comes with a micro USB cable to charge the speaker. The speaker had enough of a charge to complete the pairing and listen to it for a couple hours.Pairing is simple easy. Just power on, and hold down the ADD button. The speaker lights up and then you can find it in your bluetooth settings as Soundbox Pro+. Pairing the speaker to my phone literally took less than 2 minutes.The bass was very deep and the trebles very nice. When turned up high, the speakers do not distort whatsoever. The speaker lights up and changes color when playing music. You can change these colors too.The back of the speaker has a cover on it, and in that cover you have access to insert an SD card to play music off it, or you can plug in the aux cable to plug into a phone.The build of the speaker feels very well built. The texture feels like TPU material you'd find on some cell phone cases. It also has a good weight to it.If you need a great bluetooth speaker on a budget.

That's what you get for thinking I guess. Valuable lesson learned. I mean I'm sure it's not the worst out there so there's that, but it's just not what I thought an what I needed I wanted something louder with more power you could hear from a distance.

It is as good if not better than ones I have tried out at Walmart on their displays, like Sony and Altec Lansing. It projects sound over several rooms in my house and volume can be extremely loud without distortion. Great speaker and very good price for such good quality.

R3JT7T0Q1PUZMD,B07PMBCTSY,2.0 out of 5 stars Bluntly: Overpriced and Underwhelming,TheAdamT,2,"I read the reviews and I believed them. By the time it arrived I was frothing at the mouth, believing I had gotten great value. But there is no bargain to be had here. In fact, at a hair under $60, which is the price the speaker is listed at currently, this speaker is overpriced for the sound, features and battery life you're getting. If you're planning on playing the speaker louder than 50%(which you probably will since the volume output is low to begin with) your battery life will plumet. I run a pizza place. The speaker on a full charge did not last the entirety of my 7 hour shift. In addition to low volume output, there is nearly no bass to speak of. The bass boost button offers a modest bump that you may not even be able to hear. The specs are nice on paper, but speakers with far less wattage have performed far better to my ears. You can grab any Anker Soundcore for less than half the price and achieve similar results depending on the size of your listening area and with longer Bluetooth range and battery life. Feel pretty let down by the reviews.","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2023",AHOOYXNJZEHRZYDXT3USTR7REA5Q,TRUE,1,Color: Black

You can have 2 connected, 1 with Bluetooth and 1 with aux cable, but to me I'm not a fan as I'd like to get away from cable usage as much as possible.

R1UBAW5TTECVII,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Gone is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Quality of Yesteryear - Made in China,watch collector,3,"Made in China for BoseI was disappointed to replace my very old Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones, but they performed so long and so well, I decided to give Bose another go. Here’s what I experienced before returning them the next day:- The Bose app’s main use was toggling through the three listening modes. It has few features and is annoying to use each I need my headphones. Lose the app.- Pairing with iPhone15 pro max was simple. After that, the headphones refused to pair with other devices—permanently—repairing was constantly required, even with my many other Bose products- Function buttons on the right earpiece are difficult to find and easily activated with unintentional touches. It’s hard to say which is worse, the app or the analog function keys. I have large hands so finding and using the tiny main button and even smaller bluetooth buttons was challenging.- Saving the worst for last, and this very likely was a factory defect, but the maximum volume of these headphones is lower than my small ipod pros! A strange volume control bar on the right earpience is a bit sluggish, but the problem my set had was volume that would not go past “medium” on most other headsets.- I eagerly await Apple’s AirMax headphones.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AG2ELZHO6QIAYX7DQ7OMQZPD5ZCQ,TRUE,3,Color: Sandstone

I road trip a lot with children and needed some quiet time to get some work done, and my husband works in an office where he is constantly doing virtual meetings. These headphones have made both of these things a huge upgrade! The different modes are helpful as well. In the car I had on ""aware"" mode and was able to hear if my kids were asking me for something but could not hear that my husband had some music playing on the radio pretty loud. So crazy how you can hear one thing but it completely blocks out another!I wanted to learn more about the immersion mode so I downloaded the app. I usually don't like downloading an app for every product I have, but the demo was so useful and it explained how immersion mode works and OH MY GOSH it is so cool, it really makes you feel like you are actually seeing someone perform live.We had some confusion connecting them and learning to switch back and forth between different phones at first but it does get easier. The fact the headset only has two buttons makes it a learning curve at first to remember how many times to push the button for answering calls, ending them, skipping forward a song, skipping backward, etc gets a little confusing but once you have it down its hard to forget. My husband said they work really well for his business calls and he can hear clearly and his co workers can understand him very well. Only complaint would be I found they put too much pressure on my head that I could not adjust away. I was constantly pulling a side up to relieve the pressure, so long term use isn't for me but I was the only one that tried them in my family that had this problem. Otherwise they were quite comfortable! Overall I am very happy with this purchase and plan to use these for work and for fun for quite a while.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AEP2PIDEKJGG5Q7D7H2L3DX2NZ2A,TRUE,9,Color: Black

I guess these cushions fall apart after some use and you've got to be extra careful with them. Keep that in mind if you expect ruggedness. 4 stars overallUpdate: it doesn't really matter how good the noise cancelling is if the things don't last, and both of the cups are falling apart after 4 months (see attached image). By contrast, I Sony's lasted several years without any major issues. I've tried contacting Boae support but they do not make it easy to contact them. It's kind of a joke for what I paid for th3se headphones that they are falling apart in less than 6 months.I've had the Sony WH-1000XM4 for a few years now and compared side by side, these Bose are significantly quieter. I tested various things like A/C units, loud neighbors, fans, music and these simply block a lot more noise. I don't know how these compare against the WH-1000XM5, but online reviews say the Bose have better noise cancelling, and that was enough to make me switch to Bose this time. Comfort, connection, battery and less important stuff to me seem good so far, so I'm happy with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023",AFHI3W5K6BXRQ6GFNPK2FT7JGPCQ,TRUE,4,Color: Black

The Bose had crisper and clearer sound as well as the perfect amount of bass vs the Sonys.Noise cancelation was amazing. I laid down on my bed to relax with the Bose on quiet mode. I shut my eyes and a few minutes later I was jolted by my daughter trying to talk to me. When I took the headphones off I realized that she opened my door, walked into the room and up to the bed and began speaking to me and subsequently yelled at me. It wasn't until she physically touched me that I knew someone was in the room with me. Most definitely amazing noise cancelation.As for listening to music for long periods of time these performed great and did not cause any discomfort to my ears. After a few minutes you don't even feel that you are wearing headphones.These fold up easily and store perfectly in the included case. I tried a week of the Bose and a week of the Sonys and the Bose are the clear winner in my opinion. I would most definitely recommend and I'm very happy with these for every day use.

I wont compare them to the 800 s because the price difference.Comfort- no complaints 4.6/5. Just got a bit warm due to me playing at higher volume because i want to hear vocals.Sound- some people say that its loud and some people say its quiet. I realized why people say this. Vocals are quiet, and almost become less present/more muddy when the volume is turned up. for me, the dip in the lower treble/high mid bothered me extremely, the sole reason im returning them. I prefer there not to be a dip there so that vocals are more present. For example the airpods pro 2nd gen/hd 800 s do a much better job at this region. And even though i tried to eq through bose app, it did not fix the dip present in the vocals. If you like to to listen to ballades, jazz, or anything with a lot of singing and instruments, i wouldn’t recommend them for this reason. The airpods pro 2nd gen have much better tuning sadly. If you dont listen to vocals or dont care if they are prominent you might like these. 2.5/5Connectivity- i like that you can connect to two devices at once, it worked smoothly. 5/5Packaging-sucked, ugly box, not that it matters.Anc- quite good, 5/5Immersive audio- horrible compared to what apple has going on, not to hate. There is a crazy delay when using the motion mode, and still mode lowers sound quality, so its useless. 0/5Value- uh i think 2.5/ 5 its good for its anc, though i think anc has gotten good across the board, so I dont really care.Style -4.5/5- i find them to look niceTldr: don't like the tuning.

For all-around purposes, the QC35 was the best for both music, conference calls and phone calls. I have a pair of Sony MX3's that I use for music since it has a little more bass to them than the QC35 but, overall, the QC35 was my favorite. That said, it's almost been 4 years now and it's starting to show some wear and slowly dying on me. Time for a new headset so I went for this new QC Ultra and I'm more than satisfied with this one.Music wise, it's better than my Sonys. I did have to tinker around with the EQ a bit but I did manage to get a setting that I really like so I may just need to retire my Sonys too. For conference/phone calls, this thing is great. Easy to pair with my home/work laptops and sound and voice clarity is crystal clear.The big thing was the updated ANC. It's much better than the QC35 and the immersion setting it fantastic. Really makes the sound come through clear without any weird distortions or anything.Fit/form, these actually fit a little better than the Qc35s did. They're a big more snug, in a good way, and don't get as loose as the QC35 did. The older style buttons have been replaced with more streamlined buttons and there is a volume slider neatly integrated behind the right ear cup. Battery life is supposed to be around 24 hours but we'll see how that goes.Overall though, a really nice upgrade from the QC35.

R1GJYGGW89PVXO,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Sleek comfortable Headphone with Multipoint,Normal Consumer,5,"I've owned many headphones, earbuds, and a few noise-cancelling over-the-ear headphones like this Bose one. By far, this is the best looking and comfy headphone that I've used. I love that it features auto-on and power-saving mode when putting it on and off, so I don't have to worry about keeping it on and coming back to a dead battery. Bose's noise-cancelling headphones are known to be popular amongst those who travel frequently in the airplane rides, and while I haven't had a chance to test this in the airplane yet, it completely blocks out ambient noises like my AC running, neighbor's lawn mower, etc. Without any music playing, I'm able to hear my family conversing in the same room, but still works well. New feature called the immersion mode, is quite cool. It makes the sound more hollow as if you're in a bigger space, so that it feels more like it's coming out of the space you're in. The head-tracking mode is super interesting as you turn your head, but I don't think I'll use that feature much. My favorite part of this headphone is the multipoint. It lets me connect to both my laptop and my phone, and depending on which source is playing sound, I'll be able to hear without having to disconnect and reconnect. I wish all bluetooth audio devices supported this feature! As shown in the photo where it's folded up, I feel like a pouch might be easier to store instead of the zippered case that came with it. While it does a great job of storing it, having to align the orientation to make it flat takes some time getting used to. My head's circumference is about 59.5 cm and I have to extend the headphone all the way to fit my large head but I imagine it'll work well for most people with average head size. I'd say the headphone is definitely on the pricy side, but it's definitely a premium device that many will enjoy using.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",AFKNSDC6PPBLSXII6YLA5GBXOXJQ,TRUE,28,Color: Black

I need new headphones before my trip and it looks like I won’t get my refund until 30days. I’ll be gone by then.Definitely wanna warn people to second guess their decision. Go with an older model or Sony headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AFS53JPRDOOLQ5DKANZQ7CWLQH2A,TRUE,1,Color: Black
R39RHCVUFD0LN1,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Great pair of wireless headphones!,Krenzzler,5,"I got these to replace some Sony 1000XM4's and couldn't be happier. My problem with the Sony's were that they always had problems connecting to my Samsung TV, then they just stopped connecting one day and I couldn't find any solutions that worked. These worked perfectly right out of the box, and they connected to multiple devices flawlessly. I found that I really like the ""immersive"" mode, it just adds more presence to the sound. Overall, the sound quality is great. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't describe the quality of the sound better than that. They just sound great lol. They're comfortable and very easy to connect to devices. They also have an app you can use to tweak the sound with an equalizer. I just use them flat because that seems like the most accurate representation of the audio source to me. Also, the battery lasts a really long time. I keep thinking ""alright, I should charge"", press the battery status, and it's only like 30% down. Kind of pricey, but it seems like anything audio related is just expensive after a certain point. If you're interested in these and they go on sale, go for it, if you just really want to get them at full price, also not a bad idea, but so much tech goes on sale around the holidays, so try to hold out till then.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024",AGGRZR7RQQXUDJIVEWFEBD2CNTVQ,TRUE,26,Color: Black

I've bought many other Anker products, and decided to give these a try. I wore these on a plane for 8 and a half hours, and the noise of the plane's engines were never heard. Sound quality was great and the materials used are very nice too, soft ear cups, and deep enough to keep my ears from touching the drivers like in some other headphones. Perfect amount of clamping pressure, so they will stay put with no problem. These were well worth the 150 I bought them for, and they are definitely worth the current price of 99 bucks.

R3O8X4D0HZ70F2,B0B5VHRX7F,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones for air travel, with some quibbles",Mark M.,5,"I'll do this review as a pro/con. For reference, my previous travel headphones were the very old-school Bose QC15, which were the only game in town for true noise cancelling headphones in the day but didn't have Bluetooth (without a 3rd-party thingy with a funky charger that went into the headphone port), and they finally gave up the ghost after a long, hard travel run.PROS:1. Sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but these sound great to my ears, especially after tuning using their HearID function. (#2 below).2. The app is really helpful. I especially like the HearID (auto EQ), which provides tones of varying volume and pitch and adjusts the EQ for your hearing after making you realize you're getting old and just how many high tones you can no longer hear. It is surprising how much better music sounds after doing this, and I hate manually adjusting EQs. I use Android, and there is even a widget that allows control of the noise cancelling right from the main screen.3. Battery life. Still had battery level ""medium"" after an 11-hour international plane trip (used them for probably 7-8 hours of this).4. Noise cancelling, which works quite well on airplanes. Turn them on, and silence... sometimes I just do that without music for some peace and quiet during air travel.5. The carrying case is hard-shelled and has withstood travel well so far. Initially it can be a little tricky folding them right to fit.CONS (quibbles, really):1. They are a little bulky on the ears. They are not heavy (quite light actually), and unnoticeable when sitting upright. But using them while laying down can be a little uncomfortable.2. The pads that go around your ears are overall quite comfortable, but they don't breathe particularly well so your ears tend to get a little hot and sweaty after several hours. I think this is just the nature of around-the-ear headphones, as my Bose set had this problem but not quite as bad.3. The buttons are tiny, with black shiny icons on a matte black button. When you're getting older, the inability to hear high tones comes with the need for reading glasses to read darn near anything, so those tiny icons can be difficult to see for me. Once you're used to where buttons are, it becomes less of an issue, but they are small and take some ""muscle memory"" when they are on your ears to remember where the power button is and where the volume up/down is.Overall, even with the minor quibbles, I am really happy with them. Sound-wise, they are comparable if not a little better than my old Bose set. Functionality-wise, they are way better, especially when combined with the app and the HearID function. I think Anker has done a great job with their Soundcore line, providing a quality product for a reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2024",AHMFCRFEH3VKPE6OFHWKV55BW5AA,TRUE,65,Color: BlueSize: Medium
RKJPRV9ROQT4Q,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars The truth,Dallas,4,"Purchased with the purpose of utilizing the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation). I spend the majority of my day running lawn equipment and using the previous buds did not cut it. Hearing a podcast clearly, saving my ears from Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). I didn’t want to pay the higher price for some of the more premium headphones because they will be used primarily outdoors.The ANC does work really well. You won’t be relieved of all external noise, but the amount of noise reduction makes for a comfortable listening experience.ANC: Situational. Running a mower, a blower and a weed whip all day Can do massive damage to your hearing. These items are loud. Running them each week for your personal property.. probably not an issue.. running them for 10-12 hours a day.. very problematic. With my previous buds I would still hear the noise and I would have to turn the volume all the way up to compensate. It is not desirable. The ANC on these headphones work really well for this price. I’ve noticed that I no longer need to boost the volume all the way up to hear podcasts and music. I Can still hear the equipment, but it is minimized almost 80%. Using these in my home minimizes all of the noise. Kids? Can’t hear them. Nagging Wife? Can’t hear her. Needy cat? Can’t hear him. There are different modes of transparency as well.. this is not glorified as it should be in the marketing. Having a conversation with my wife and having the headphones on while in “talk” setting of the transparency mode was simply beautiful! Imagine being in a room filled with soundproofing… completely empty. The voice is crisp and clear. The chip takes away other noises that aren’t voices. Totally cool experience. One negative is that the ANC microphones that are used to gauge the environmental sounds pick up wind on a very windy day and you can hear it.The build of the headphones is not desirable, in my opinion. They feel like they were built really well. They don’t feel “cheap”. The headphones are made of plastic with really soft ear cushions and a soft head cushion. The issue I have with these are that the pivot points/hinges are very loose. They feel “floppy”. This may be a personal preference, but it’s a big one for me. I expect these to be extremely loose later down the line. I’m not an engineer, so I may be crazy. They are comfortable and light. They are made with plastics that don’t feel cheap and clunky. Made with cheaper materials.. but crafted nicely. The headphones ARE NOT WATER PROOF. The ear cups don’t apply uncomfortable pressure on your temple like some other headphones I’ve used.. total plus! These are not good if you get sweaty. Which should be assumed because of the Noise cancelation, but they get real wet! If you plan to use these for the gym or running… probably not the best option.Build of the case: AWFUL. I’m going to buy a generic one Awful. When the headphones arrive and you open them up they look so comfortable in the case. They are supported with a temporary packing plastic that hold the cups. Then… like taking a tent out of the bag and trying to get it back in the same way… problem arrives. The headphones do not easily sit flat in the case. When you place them in and try to zip it one of the cups sits high and you can’t close it without compressing the headphones to the point they feel as if they are going to break. After playing an uncomfortable game of Tetris, you get them to go in without bulking.Sound Quality: Don’t read the ones that say, “the bass sucks”. I agree that the preset of the headphones is less than desirable for listening to music or watching action movies, but that’s just the preset. DOWNLOAD THE APP THAT CONTROLS THE HEADPHONES! Downloading the app gives you so many options for the EQ. You also have the ability to create your own setting. I found comfort in using the preset option and toggling the bass boost to get my preferred setting. There are MANY MORE options to choose. Find the settings that you prefer. I feel like they are well balanced. They aren’t your Beats by Dre kick, but you get a decent bass kick.Battery:The battery life is awesome.. just not as awesome as they say. While having the ANC activated and listening to music or podcasts at the highest volume.. you aren’t getting 50 hours of battery life. You are getting a really long lasting life and the battery does charge completely within a few hours. Quick charging: I have yet to need this function. I charge them at night and put them on in the morning. If you used ANC and had the volume at medium I could see the 50 hour battery life.All-in-All: I’m happy with the purchase. They compete with some brands that are double the price and they function exactly how I need them to. Fix the dang case. You won’t feel like you wasted $160. I promise","Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2022",AGX2CEFC5QV5TGYY7UC47FJMFEVA,TRUE,328,Color: BlackSize: Medium
RQWFRY0J94DIT,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars The best bluetooth headphones I've heard for the price range,mpilgrim,5,"Nowadays, I wouldn't buy a pair of bluetooth headphones blindly (or deafly?) online unless it comes with an app that allows you to tweak the sound/EQ. There's no point in spending money on a pair of headphones, only to not like the sound when they arrive. There are 3rd-party EQ phone apps, but those are sometimes dubious, plus they only work with the phone/tablet device being used at the time. It's best to have the native headphone's app do it within the headphones themselves, in which the custom EQ settings travel with the headphones to whatever device/system is being used -- even those without the possibility of EQ apps. So with built-in EQ, you don't have to worry as much about whether the headphones match your preferred sound profile -- at least, to a point, since some things like soundstage and the ""feel"" of open vs. closed headphones can't be customized, although the ""Transparency"" app settings sort of emulate the latter a bit, albeit via noise cancellation.These headphones come with a really good app for configuring most things (with one feature request down below*), including the EQ, noise cancelation, volume limiter, firmware updates, etc. You can also configure the headphones to auto-power-off if not in-use after 30/60/90/120 minutes or ""never"" (default is 60 minutes). The 8-band EQ has a 21 presets (or 22 if you count the ""BassUP"" on/off toggle on their ""sound core Signature"" preset), along with allowing to create/save multiple custom EQ profiles. The app finds and connects to the headphones immediately with both my Pixel 7 and Pixel 3 (which I now use as just a tiny tablet, since it only has WiFi). I only have Android phones, so I can't speak for the iPhone app, but I'd guess that it is the same, other than the LDAC stuff (which Apple devices don't support, and will default to AAC). Note that these headphones don't support any aptX protocols, so your options are LDAC/AAC/SBC for Android devices and AAC/SBC for Apple devices (both phones and computers). My computer is an Apple MacBook Air M1, so I can vouch for the AAC connection on that, although when sitting at my computer, I prefer using my wired headphones (Beyerdynamic 880's). But overall, I am liking these Q45's more than my Sennheiser HD 350BT bluetooth headphones.I don't really use noise cancelation, so I can't speak to that in subjective terms, and so keep in mind that my rating does not take into account noise cancellation. But in terms of features, it has a lot of customization, with both traditional NC modes (with five custom levels plus adaptive/automated) as well as separate transparency modes (with five custom levels plus ""talk"" mode). But even with the NC turned off (""Normal"" setting), the headphones actually block-out quite a bit of noise naturally, since they seem to form an almost air-tight suction.The battery seems to last long too. I'm a person that re-charges any device before it goes below 60%, so I can't say how long a full battery drain lasts, but I go quite awhile between charges nonetheless, even using LDAC (which uses more battery). In AAC/SBS mode (not LDAC), probably slightly better than my Sennheiser HD 350BT's, while in LDAC mode, probably a bit worse (but only a bit).For comfort, I find these very comfortable with prolonged use.I just bought a new Pixel 7 phone (w/Android 13), and the bluetooth w/LDAC works extremely well with this phone/headphone combo, with no connectivity issues under reasonable use, even when LDAC is forced to 990kbps. The headphones also connect to the phones fairly quickly. In terms of holding the connection w/LDAC, I live in a two-bedroom apt with each bedroom on opposite ends of the apt, separated by ~20 feet. I put the phone in the furthest corner of one bedroom, shut the door, and walked around the apt:--LDAC @990kbps: It worked fine without any skips up to ~30 feet away and through one wall (including door closed). I didn't start to have skips until going into the other bedroom with its door also closed -- so not until over 30 feet away and through two walls.--LDAC @660kbps: I couldn't break it within my apt. No skips, even in the second bedroom with both bedroom doors closed -- so it still worked at ~35 feet away and through two walls (including both doors closed).--I didn't bother checking 330kbps, since 660kbps worked so well in all my scenarios.--LDAC Best Effort (Adaptive): Same behavior as @660kbps (never breaks/skips), which tells me that Android isn't actually operating at @990kbps (either part of the time or never), even though the Android ADB logs always say @990kbps at initial connection with no subsequent changes. So at least partially, it is operating @660kbps or @330kpbs. But the vagueness of Adaptive LDAC mode isn't the fault of these (or any) headphones -- this is an Android issue. However, the choice to use Adaptive LDAC mode in the first place is controllable, which brings me to my one gripe below...*My one complaint/request for the app is that it could force-customize the LDAC settings. All it allows you to do is enable LDAC (Preferred auto quality) or disable LDAC (Combine audio and connection, which then defaults to AAC). In the Android Developer settings, it always defaults to ""Best Effort/Adaptive"", which doesn't tell you what it's doing, even in the ADB logs, which only logs 990kbps at first connection, but never logs subsequent adaptive changes.There's a Sony Music Center app that works for some people in forcing the LDAC bit rate mode, but when I tried it, it only worked around 50% of the time on both my Pixel 7 w/Android 13 and Pixel 3 w/Android 12, so I ended-up removing the app. But it apparently works for others, and if Sony can apparently force the LDAC settings within their app, why shouldn't the SoundCore app be able to do it too? I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like the SoundCore app to force-customize the LDAC settings. Ideally, I'd like it to control the actual bit rate mode (ie, explicitly set it to 990kbps or 660kbps), as well as set the sample rate and bit size, since I don't listen to music beyond 44.1kHz/16-bit anyway, and so I also like to down-tune the sample rate/bit size to 44.1kHz/16-bit, to save a bit of phone battery. But at the very least, the app should be able to force-set the main LDAC bit rate setting (990/660/330/adaptive), so we don't have to go into the Android Developer settings every time the headphones re-connect. It's a minor nuisance, but considering that LDAC is a major selling point of the headphones -- you'd think they'd want to allow people to ensure ideal LDAC settings? Regardless, I'd still give these headphones five stars for the price range.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AHUCLS7VNI2OJI26YL6QJIN7XMNQ,TRUE,232,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R2D57JZN4T3NNB,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Upgrade to the Q30,Kelly V,5,"I have had these for a few months now and would like to share a few thoughts on my experience with them. I was using and enjoying the Soundcore Q30s and had read some positive and mixed reviews on the Q45s so I was curious and wanted to find out what an upgrade from the same company would sound like. Spoiler alert ...Yes I do recommend with a couple of caveats.The Q30s kinda blew me away when i first heard them and i expected a lot from the Q45s. I was at first not impressed. Like.. Where's the bass? EQing did not seem to help the bass much and like some reviewers, i felt the highs could be too sharp and bitey. I considered immediately returning them yet got too busy with other things and that window passed. I did continue to use them and compare with the Q30s and did notice they were very clear and I could hear mids and highs i could not with the Q30s. Now I am glad I kept them. So what changed? Well, I feel the bass has gotten better after a couple 3 months. A lot better. I now know why many reviews on these were so ho hum. According to Soundcore, their drivers are made of a different material. Apparently, they, IMO, require burn in time. I think most reviewers dont have the required time to take with them for the drivers to open up or even EQ them. Which is why you must always take product reviews with a grain of salt. Anyway the bass and subbass have greatly improved, being much tighter and less muddy than the Q30s ,yet they do not overpower the mids and highs. The highs have seemed to have become less bitey as well. They are also more comfortable than the Q30s with better cushioning. So are they the best sounding headphones I have tried? No, but i think they get fairly close. More on that later. They are also not vey attractive IMO and are kinda huge looking with the can on can thing going on. I bought the blue because it was different and now i think I would go with the black so as to look a little smaller and less nerdy. They are not super light either so i would not recommend for the gym or running,. However, if you do not mind the burn in time required for the bass to improve and dont mind spending a few minutes EQing them to tune them , I do highly recommend!......Update....Something had been bothering me about these headphones. In particular, I would read the occasional review where they would talk about enabling LDAC. I finally realized I had never been prompted or even seen any LDAC option. LDAC is supposedly a big selling point on these headphones. Not one for allways reading directions, I had assumed it was an automatic default kinda thing. Well,after going back into the Soundcore app. I finally found out why I had never seen it. It is like hidden almost under the settings cogwheel icon and, even though I was shown as having been up to date, it requires its own seperate download to even enable the button. Man, to think I have been listening to these for months without even knowing I was going without it. Turns out I have been really missing out. Don't let anyone or any AI-written article tell you it is hardly noticable or whatever. It makes a difference! It makes the music sound a bit more live. It allows you to hear the breathiness and a lot of other details in the music. Without adding volume or distortion. It really puts these on a whole different level than without the LDAC enabled. I really am embarrassed I just found this out. How many people have bought these and returned them without ever knowing they can sound better? Now they sound, to my ears, almost as good as the newer Beats premium cans ( which are excellent IMO). More on those later... You will also want to make sure your'e music streaming is set to highest quality and ignore any warnings about data limitations or whatnot in the app.! I pay for Spotify Premium and I had to go through the menu tools and change them. So now I'll give a quick word on how the Q45s compare to a couple other cans I have owned or tried. ---- Beats Studio Pro-- I purchased the Beats thinking they had an app. EQ I could configure. They, of course do not have one. I was planning on returning them when I realized this. After listening to them a couple days I realized I really liked their sound signature. They sound sooo bright. Way more bright than I thought I would care for. Their sound engineers worked some magic on them. I am very sensitive to 8K fingernail on chalkboard distortion that usually comes with overly bright treble and these got none of that. I allways considered myself somewhat of a basehead before but not anymore! The lack of an app. also makes them great for non-technical people who don't want to have to spend time configuring them. They sound great right out of the gate. Bass is excellent. You just have to turn the up a little past medium for it to really kick in. To be sonically perfect I think they do need a bass-up button for lower volumes. It is in the comfort area that they fall short. Think...vice grips for the head. I can only wear for about an hour at a time. That said, I think one would get used to them if they were you're only pair. The Q45s are way more comfortable while ,now with the LDAC, are close to being on par with them in sound quality. IMO. ...Update... O.k. After doing a lot of a-b listening of the studio pro with the Q45s I gotta admit the Beats are on a bit of a different level. They are just so ultra lively and clear. Like you are the 1st or second row away from the stage whereas the Soundcore are just a few more rows away. They do this all while using the inferior SBC codec which makes me think Spotify, even at its highest streaming level, is still not good enough quality to take advantage of LDAC. Still the Soundcore are close and I think get just a hair closer when I use the wired connection. And ,of course, they are half the cost.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024",AGHP4CUAVYIMMKSP3KIB33WRRJEQ,TRUE,54,Color: BlueSize: Medium

Multipoint connection works. They are default tuned nicely and the app has an equalizer for more specific needs. The battery life is superb!HOWEVER, they are absolutely huge and clunky. Anyone with an average to small sized head would not be able to wear these. I found them sliding if I looked down or up. This might be due to their weight and light head clamp. The ear cups are massive and don't fully rest on my head. This reduced the effectiveness of the noise cancellation because there was a gap. These headphones also stick out pretty far from the head. I've heard other reviewers refer to it as the ear cups having their own ear cups.

R19TGWDYIQ2YOQ,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Soundcore Q45 Headphones,Glen,5,"Let me start by first saying that I'm no audiophile.However, I appreciate great clarity, sound quality and richness in my music when I do listen to it.I didn't buy these headphones for the purpose of making and receiving cellphone calls. So I will not be addressing that feature personally. Go to Youtube and watch reviews like I did before purchasing these to make that decision for yourself. Most reviews I did watch gave them a positive rating though concerning that aspect.Regarding the noise cancellation feature, there are 3 different options. The level of noise allowed through between the 3 is very distinctly different to my ears. Transparency mode allows you to hear practically everything going on around you like your not wearing the headphones. Normal mode is basically like wearing, well a pair of headphones. And Noise Cancelling mode greatly diminishes noise in your surroundings. I wore these in NC mode while the tv was on in my house, people talking, and outside traffic going up and down the road. When listening to Led Zeppelin at around 80 decibels, which is close to the maximum safe range per Soundcore's app, I was in my own world with rare sound disturbances.Speaking of Soundcore's app. If you buy these headphones and don't utilize the app, you are cheating yourself! The app is easy to use and packed full of options to customize/tailor these headphones to suit your specific tastes. The sound quality of these headphones on the lows, mids and highs is AMAZING in my opinion! And if you take advantage of purchasing the Q45's when on sale, your getting an EXCELLENT deal! I can't speak from personal experience. But I've read and watched many reviews comparing these headphones to ones that cost two to three times the price.The over-the-ear cups are very comfortable. And while the headband may not have as much padding as some other models. As a bald guy, I had no issues with finding them uncomfortable. I must have a smaller head though because I didn't need to adjust the headband out at all. For a child, these would be too big.I had these in my Amazon cart at the regular Soundcore price. But I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend that price. Then about a week later, Amazon notified me of a price drop. That's when I saw they were being sold for the same price of their lesser models. It was a no brainer at that point. I'm absolutely thrilled with the quality, sound performance, features and hard case provided with the Q45's.While on sale, I was tempted to buy a second pair tbh!

R9Q3A4VVNXOJ3,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Compare to the Bose Ultra and Sony M4 at twice the price,ZenReader,5,"I used a pair of Bose Ultra's on a trip to Europe and found the ANC stellar. Sound quality is a personal experience but they delivered the ""Bose"" sound -clear, rounded, no peaks and valleys. Its a No surprise offering. I got the Sony M4's late and ended up buying the Soundcore to fill a travel gap. At half the price I was pleasantly surprise at the sound quality of the Soundcore -the sound has a much fuller ""sound stage"" than the Bose (more open). I returned the Bose for the Sony offering after reading the reviews. I find the Soundcore very comfortable and the controls easily reached. ANC is above average, better than good but not Sony/Bose level. The one thing about the Bose/Sony is their ability to block ambient noise without ANC turned on. Since the Soundcore does not have the level of ambient blocking, less quality materials I think it starts off at a disadvantage. But at $149 it does the job on airplanes while delivering a very pure sound. The Sony M4 is more refined and I find the sound warmer than the M5. Again its a personal taste thing. If your looking for a decent wireless headset, pure sound, great battery -Soundcore delivers. If you have other Bose products and like its sound pay double and go Bose Ultra. I kept the Sony and am still finding my way around them --they're a lot more techy which I kind of like.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFCAOU36WNQYWE33ZZU7LISDBEOQ,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: Medium

Some only seemed to be Bluetooth which wouldn’t work for him and were eliminated.The Anker Soundcore Space Q34 received high ratings for their price point. Amazon offered them at a special price; the carrying case, charging cable and aux cable were included so I thought I would give them a try for our upcoming trip.

RKRM6810UB9NC,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Had a problem with some squeaking noises in transparency mode but Anker made it right,Eric Work,5,"The product came in 1 day from Amazon and was exactly as described. Everything was working great in all my tests except in transparency mode there was some squeaking sound kind of like markers on a whiteboard from the right side. I opened a case from the mobile app and had a replacement at my door in less than a week. The replacement appears to be a slightly newer model (Before: A3040011 FW: 6.34 vs After: A3040012 FW: 2.34) which has slightly thicker ear pads. No issues with the replacement product so I'm satisfied. I got my kids renewed versions of the Space Q45 which is how I knew the squeaking sound wasn't normal.I found the richness of the audio to be a little less than my previous headphones (Wyze Headphones). After going through the HearID profile set up process it improved the sound quality IMO. I'd also recommend looking into the ""Alternative A2DP Driver"" for Windows which enables LDAC support and improves the audio quality. On Linux (Fedora 39) LDAC just worked out of the box, which is +1 for Linux.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFC2DW2MHHQBNBZV2PMV6MWQNDSQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: Medium

For less than a $150, you are getting phenomenal sound, great noise cancelling, in a VERY LIGHT package. I highly recommend doing the custom eq setup in the app. The sound was good at stock settings, but the custom eq process (takes about 5 minutes) really wakes these up. I found the stock bass to be VERY heavy, but after it was much cleaner and more manageable.And they don't look like something an alien designed, so I'll be able to take them to the office without getting the side eye from the boss.May end up buying a pair for my wife.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AGLB5ZTVPBJAY3DVFD5EQ5NTWEFQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlueSize: Medium

I’m not an audiophile but I did want good sound and noise canceling. When I’m around the house, I like to read and watch YouTube videos. I wanted ANC headphones that would tune out the gas leaf blowers that run nearly every day near our home… they drive me up the wall! These headphones do a great job of tuning out the leaf blowers and allow me to listen to classical music or a YouTube without all that aggravating noise. They also do a good job of blocking out conversations I don’t want to hear while I’m reading.I own several Anker products and find they all deliver good quality at a fair price point. I can’t see spending $300 for a pair of headphones. Maybe Bose and Sony are better, but I can’t see how they justify 3X the price. In my opinion they can’t be that much better.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AGOEBKUMOM477U3VFP4UQ4P3LCQQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R24UV88IGKODWP,B0B5VHRX7F,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is good, comfort is good, pairing is smooth and easy, ANC is just meh",ceil in dallas,4,"The one thing about these headphones you might not understand from other reviews is that the quality of the ANC is HIGHLY dependent on the frequency of the noise. High-frequency noise (such as people talking, or radio, or silverware clattering) is, at best, a little muffled by the ANC. On the other hand, it does a pretty good job of blocking out lower frequency noise, like the hum of a refridgerator, or an engine.So if what you want the ANC for is blocking out sounds in an office with a lot of chatter, this is not going to do much for you. And on an airplane it may block out the sound of the engines, but if a kid starts screaming, this ANC won't save you.","Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2024",AEBW2VMORVARO4E4W4NOJOQJVX3Q,TRUE,0,Color: BlueSize: Medium

I tried:Sennheiser HD 450SEJBL Tour ONESony WH-XB910NTOZO HT2Plus a few other onesThe close to fitting was the TOZO HT2, but the depth of the earcups was too shallow for me and the speaker rested uncomfortable on my ear. The Sennheiser and Sony were hilariously small, the Sennheiser is simple not an over ear headphone for anyone over the age of 6 >_>The Soundcore Q45 fit fully around my ears, and have enough depth that the speaker portion does not rest on my ear. I have worn them for about a week now and they have been comfortable for me for hours of wear.The sound out of the box is a little flat and neutral. There is an app that has an EQ and a sound personalization wizard which seemed to work well for me. The app also lets you adjust the strength of the noise canceling, which I like because very strong noise canceling can make me a bit dizzy after a while. The headphones let you directly turn off noise canceling completely with one of the buttons.After so many failed attempts to find something that fits me(and lets me turn off ANC...looking at you bose) I'm quite happy with these.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AE3Z3UG63657O4M4XC2YR7TC2VKQ,TRUE,3,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R33EHS7GSUWTJ6,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing value for money,Richard Fichera,5,"I can't speak to the longevity of these headphones, but my initial impression is very positive. They are not quite as good as the expensive Sony headphones that I gave to my son, but they were on sale for $100, almost exactly 25% of the cost of the Sony units. The noise cancellation is subjectively excellent, sound quality is more than adequate, and the controls are also adequate, with easy to find and manioulate on/off, volume and NC mode. The ""transparency mode"" is pretty good in a quiet environment, not sure how it will fare on an airplane.Build quality seems good, with some obvious compromises in padding and feel of materials to get down to the their price point. For my purposes, occasional use at home and a few times a year on airplanes, they should last me for quite a while.Anker appears to be making strong efforts to climb up the food chain and distance itself from other prolific makers of peripherals and power units (to name a few of their products), and if these Q45s (playing shamelessly upon Bose's nomenclature) are an indicator of their trajectory, the likes of Bose and Sony should be very concerned.Anker has several NC headphones, and I chose these after listening to reviews that highlighted their slightly better NC and microphone should I ever want to sue them with my phone. Unless you are ultra-discerning about sound quality, you will probably enjoy having an extra $300 more or less in your pocket and these Anker headphones on your head rather than having the highest end Bose or Sony headphones. Evven at their full list price of $139 they will remain a great value for the money.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AF4PSALYPCAJTKS4UBXG3Y4A377A,TRUE,3,Color: BlackSize: Medium

R33ZD78WVPVC0,B0B5VHRX7F,"5.0 out of 5 stars You will NOT find anything even as close to the quality, for the same price!!",Our Reviews and Stuff,5,"HIGHLY...HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!I can't count the number of headphones I've had to return due to poor sound quality, ANC was a joke, the charging port fell inside, etc.. etc.. But the Q45s have brought a whole new, top notch, low cost headphone to the market, even crushing Anker's former models!PROS:- Price! I've purchased at least 10 different headphones in this price range, only to return them or have them break within a year- Sound! Excellent for the price range. Even phone calls are OK. There IS an EQ you can download for your phone which helps a lot!- 3 modes for background noise: (1) ANC - Active noise canceling, (2) Normal and (3) Transparency - so you can listen to your music while amplifying what is going on around you. Great for walking in traffic, public transport, watching TV and listening for your laundry or kids etc.- ANC: Amazing - it will blow your mind! My husband can be vacuuming, and I can easily hear what I'm watching!!- DUAL connections: I can have these connected to my phone as well as my TV/Computer. I can watch a movie, and answer my phone. The headsets will automatically turn off my TV and switch to my phone as soon as I accept a call. Love this feature!- AUTO turn off: I can listen to meditation streaming and fall asleep, knowing these will turn off automatically after not receiving an incoming signal after roughly 30 min - 1 hr. Great battery saver!- BATTERY LIFE is outstanding: I believe it's marketed as 45 hours? I would say that's roughly what I get. Although, I use the ANC all the time, so it may be a little lower. Good news is they charge super quickly with the 3.0 USB plug!- CONTROLS are very simple, easy to use, and can do almost anything. Minor issue: I have not figured out how to jump to the next song/video in my playlist. There may be a way, but I'm so happy with everything else, I don't even care!- COMFORT: I use mine mostly to watch TV/Movies streaming. I can easily spend a lazy Sunday with these on all day and NOT have any complaints about comfort. The padding in the ears is TOP NOTCH, the headpiece padding is good, and the adjustability of the height is wonderful. I find the tension which they squeeze on my ears to be good enough to feel snug, but not so strong that it will cause a headache or 'ear fatigue' after wearing for an entire day.- Did I mention PRICE?: You CANNOT do any better for the price - trust me, I've tried! Even purchased a couple of the name brands (Sony, Sennheiser, Cowin, etc) at the lower 'Refurbished' price making them the same price as the Anker Q45s, and none of them were as good as these! (I did keep my Cowins as back ups - but still not as good).- Compared to other ANKER products: I had the Q30s (they were OK) and the Q35s (a little better) and the new Q45s are such a huge improvement!- RANGE: I live in a 2 story townhome. I can go anywhere in my home, and even a few feet outside, and still have reception. I would say after about 50 feet, it becomes a little spotty.CONs: (I don't really have any, but maybe for some of you?):- Because the pads are made out of pleather, I wouldn't use these to work out with. They would be very hot, and the sweat would probably make them slippery.- If you're looking for a set of headphones to travel with a lot, these aren't bad. They do fold up, and swivel about 70 degrees on each headset. I know other brands may do a little better here. I use mine at home, so I don't have an issue with this.- I wish the EQ app was a little better, and I could load on my computer rather than just my phone. I probably can, I'm just too lazy to figure it out?","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AELXNQ4WLN3SGWBXZPHR4D2SBYAA,TRUE,169,Color: WhiteSize: Medium

Sound quality is great, i love the app with the EQ option. I can customize the audio so that my audio books sound like theres someone sitting next to me reading. They have a variety of EQ presets to choose from (including spoken word, but inchose to tweak mine a bit) and you can make multiple custom EQ things.My biggest qualm is the noise cancelling. It is freaking great if you dont wear glasses and you hold your head still so that it doesnt break the seal of the earcup. But i wanted a pair that i can wear at work while im doing stuff and moving and wearing glasses. The ANC changes whenever i move my head and that seal is broken, which is multiple times a minute. I would have been happy with paying more for this pair of headphones for the extended battery and getting rid of the touch switch option! (Q30s offer a “feature” where it switches to transparency mode when the right earcup is touched. The fact that the Q45s dont have it is one of the reasons i upgraded)But it feels silly to upgrade just because i dont want a “feature, and the difference between 40 and 50 hours isnt that huge.

R32Z9BC0P87US7,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Must do software updates to get sound quality,TeaDragon,4,"Edit to add: After using these for a while, they developed a terrible funky stench. I've never had this with any other headphones, on-ear or over-ear. There is really no air flow at all, and just going for walks puddles up the sweat in there, which these materials seem to have no resistance to. These headphones still sound great, still work great, but I find myself not using them, because after a little while that horrible smell comes back and becomes unbearable. So, warning, if you are going to walk around with these in the summer, look for other options.Quick edit to add: These headphones intensely stink of chemical/plastic smell out of the box. After 4 days, they no longer make the entire room stink, but they still stink if you put them on your head or sniff them. Seems like it will air out _eventually_, but be aware. It's intense and unpleasant.TL;DR: If losing multi-device connection and some battery life isn't worth it to get good sound, then DO NOT buy these, as they aren't for you.I had a set of UE 9000 headphones that lasted a decade before refusing to charge any batteries any longer. I tried some other form factors, but wanted to go back to a set of cans with large drivers for maximum sound quality. After 3 days, here's an initial review.Terrible sound out of the box (but fixable):Taking the Soundcore Space Q45s out of the box and connecting to my Android phone, I was horrified by the terrible audio quality compared to the ancient APTX codec UE 9000 pair. I mean, crackling on mellow layered music like Enya. Static on the soft parts of other music. No matter what music player EQ I tried, it was just awful. I mean, just terrible in a shocking way. I couldn't believe it could be worse sounding than my decade-old bluetooth headphones after all of the rave reviews. Then I realized my phone's Bluetooth connection to them was NOT using the LDAC codec I had expected, but AAC. Oh.Fixing the sound quality:Fixing this required installing the Soundcore app on the phone, then doing a firmware update multiple times (with multiple headphones reboots), then changing the setting in the app to enable ""Preferred audio quality"". This then updates the firmware/settings in the device one _again_ and suddenly it's like you have a different set of headphones! Really, you sacrifice the multiple device connection feature and some battery life, but it is worth it! I bought these hoping for Hi-Res music quality, and before these updates, I definitely did not have it. If losing multi-device connection and some battery life isn't worth it to get good sound, then DO NOT buy these, as they aren't for you.Call quality:People tell me I sound good and clear, but I find if I speak softly I sometimes need to repeat myself.Controls:Real buttons, hurray! Controls work well, but while you can skip tracks, there's no built in way to fast forward or skip forward _within_ a song. You can replace the track skip with a fast forward type action inside the settings of some individual apps. Not having this built into the heaphone controls is one real weakness of the Space Q45.Ergonomics:I'm accustomed to large cans. The UE9000 pair were far heavier than these (more metal). I wear an XL or 7 1/2 hat size, and these do work. The bottom of the cups come further down than any wired or wireless cans I've ever used. Just about to the bottom of my jaw joint. The band also sits further back on the top of the head than most, and the cups tilt forward. Takes some getting accustomed to. At first, I tried to wear them positioned more like other headphones, but this made my ears sore due to pressing the earlobes down. I think I have the positioning figured out, so time will tell. The cups also seem to be less deep, so that the center of the cups touch my ears a bit.Also, they will make your ears hot/sweaty more than some others.","Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2022",AF2KYH6SZ6VZXPETKNVJTA2BLJDQ,TRUE,39,Color: BlackSize: Medium

RK9HG2XUFDVDZ,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars (updated impressions: Sound is much better wirelessly) Not very good sounding at all,M. Kinn,4,"Initial impressions are:ANC isn't much of anything. Hard to tell the difference between off and on.Sound quality isn't all that good in wireless mode in. When I first powered them on they required a firmware update. When I tried to turn on LDAC, they required another firmware update. And after subsequently enabling LDAC, I listened for a few minutes. The sound seemed better, but I didn't listen long in wireless. I wanted to get to the wired mode...I plugged these into my FiiO Q11 DAC/amp connected to my laptop with Amazon Music UltraHD streaming and PC audio set to 32 bit, 192Kh (studio quality).Music seems like it's just at the plane of the drivers rather than having a wide soundstage. Bass and especially sub bass doesn't seem to be tightly controlled.Yeah, I just pulled up a song I'm very familiar with and the sound is flat and lifeless. Nevertheless, I'm going to see if burn-in will help...(updated impressions):After burn-in, the sound didn't improve for wired mode so I shelved these Q45. However, I chose to pull them back out and use them in wireless mode and they do sound better.When I first unboxed them I listened to them in wireless mode only briefly to check out the ANC mainly. Wired mode is what I most interested in because of the purity of a wired sound. I gave that up after trying to make them sound better. Nevertheless, I decided to give them more listening time in wireless mode and am finding that they do sound better. The bass is not as muddy and the overall sound is clearer and crisper with a much better soundstage.Their good qualities are:Comfort - they have properly sized ear cups that fit my large ears wellBuild - they are built very well and feel premiumSound in wireless mode (Bluetooth) - using the LDAC codec, they are much better soundingPrice - they are priced well below other brands that offer the high quality build and constructionThe things not so good (very few)ANC - I still can't tell much of a difference between on and off. There are cheaper headphones that provide much better ANCWired listening mode - Their overall sound is overwhelmed by muddy, bass that is not tightly controlledand their soundstage isn't very goodIf you buy these, buy them for their wireless performance. Don't for ANC or expect a quality wired performance","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2023",AHXXETVUBCMPVOYAXNUSVQARIUZQ,TRUE,8,Color: BlackSize: Medium

I was just looking for a budget option for good headphones to see if I like using them before purchasing some more ""premium"" ones in the future, however I think I will be happy enough with these for a while!The pros:-The form factor, these are stylish and come in several nice colors(although I wouldn't have minded a few more options.-The noise canceling, works how I like it too, you can tell if someones speaking but you don't hear the AC or ambient sounds that get distracting.-Easy set up and great battery life, it think I've only had to charge them 3 times in the time I've had them.The Cons- Heavy compared to some other (much more budget-friendly) headphones these are the heaviest and that makes them less comfortable over time so they aren't great for super long sessions, and they tend to get hot on my ears.- I'm no audiophile but I will say the sound quality is good, but not the most amazing, I feel like these are on par with my AirPods(3rd Gen) with a little more bass in addition to the noise canceling.MehsThe app, being able to control the level of noise canceling as well as transparency sounded like a great feature, but I don't use it very often as the differences between levels 1-5 seem negligible at best.You can also adjust the levels of bass, midrange and treble which form my testing also seems to make the sound better but it's not night and day.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024",AGGL4DIINJHNDAOVJMVA5BLZIUBA,TRUE,2,Color: WhiteSize: Medium
RRD7ZPM08MLQA,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Anker. Always solid.,HJeffK,5,"I have had and owned so many great ear buds and headphones over the years from Sony, Bose, M&D, Sennheiser, and everyone in between. Anker has always been my go to budget brand for peripherals and occasionally buds and cans. I owned the Q35's and loved them. My last Sony cans were appropriated on a divorce. Long story, but for another day. I had a recent business trip to Hawaii and was bringing a date so I gave her my Q35's and bought these, thinking that 9 hours of use would be better served with cans instead of in ear buds. I was so right. Like the 35's, these are not nearly as good as their big name competitors, but they are still really good and are a five star value overallIn terms of sound, these are really good. You can stream LDAC with the right device, but even without, these are very good. Lots of bass with good separation from the mids and highs. Not world class but you will like listening to these. The noise cancelling these do is really good. They wipe out plane noise and all but the most sudden noises. The battery life is awesome. You can expect over 45 hours no matter how loud you go. They are comfortable for long periods as well. Plus, big bonus over the 35's, call quality is as good or better than anything I have ever used including Sony and Bose. These just generally do everything above average or better.If you have the money to drop on the latest Sony or Bose cans, do it. They are better and worth the upgrade. However, most folks will love these and never miss the better options for the money. Anker Sound core is a great company that makes great things for a fair price. The Q45’s are no exception.

R29B9TZC3AN1G4,B0B5VHRX7F,"4.0 out of 5 stars Still an excellent value. Good sound, comfortable fit, more than decent ANC.",Mowrind,4,"I wore out my Q30's and decided to try upgrading. After a couple of more expensive and slightly better sound-profile models from major brands, two things became apparent: (1) Headphones designed to be 'stable' for exercise, etc., are going to be less comfortable--they squeeze your head like a vice. (2) ANC implementation tends to be weak or weird (pressure, unevenness, etc.) on these higher end audio units. Not tried: Bose. But thorough reviews suggest the sound profile for them is not all that great for what they cost--and you get maybe -5db more in ANC overall.Bottom line: Q45 is super comfortable and the ANC is both substantial and not weird. I don't use them for exercise (that's what buds are for), and I think they would tend to fall off or just move around too much if I did. But these are near-perfect 'sit and listen' headphones. At half or less the price of a pair of Bose ANC headphones, the buy decision for Q45 is a no brainer for my use case.","Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2024",AFUWAKEV4TGMISJI5QCRH7BENOQA,TRUE,0,Color: WhiteSize: Medium

R9UA6NHWSUPOH,B0B5VHRX7F,3.0 out of 5 stars Anker Space Q42 ANC is average,J.M.,3,"Even an average ANC helps a lot when listing to others during a phone call, or a conference, or watching a video while in a noisy environment.I compared Anker Space Q45 with Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II and Sony WH-1000XM5 headset.I used the steady noise of a running faucet for reference.My perception is that at a 50 dB noise level, Bose cuts out 98% of the noise, Q45 cuts out 70%, Sony XM5 95%. This type of noise is very low, like an AC vent, but can be a distraction when one has to focus briefly. I highly recommend using an ANC on long flights since it reduces fatigue.Fun fact: I tried wearing Sony headset on top of the Bose earbuds. It is uncomfortable but it can silence 60 dB. Flushing of a toilet, 75 dB, sounds like a gentle murmur ;-)Things to consider:Q45 is 2-3 times cheaper than Sony XM5. Q45 can't remove a steady low volume noise of AC vent. Q45 ANC is marginally better than a Jabber's headset.I would caution to consider the quality of the microphone in a noisy environment. Most reviews demonstrate that Sony XM5 is the best. I found that the microphone in the Bose earbuds perform poorly in a very noisy environment. I didn't test Q45 microphone.Bose usability/connectivity is beyond horrible, but when it works, it has the best noise cancellation.It is possible to sleep with the earbuds.Wearing any earbuds for many hours every day can cause ear skin irritation.Wearing any headset for more than 1 hour causes ears to get too hot.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AF5YA3PJLCUWXD3IPHU2JKRNB5SA,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: Medium

It seems reasonable to compare these to the XM4s.First and fore-most the Sonys ARE nicer. They have a more premium feel, the materials feel higher quality, and they are lighter. The comparison I would make are that the Sonys are like a Mercedes, but these are certainly a Honda or Toyota. The sound is incredible. The signature sound with bass up sounds really good to me, but I have also used the very excellent equalizer, and have them tuned to sound almost exactly like the XM4s. In fact, if you blindfolded me I not sure I would be able to tell the difference between the two.Noise cancelling is terrific. I used them this morning in the gym, and with the NC turned on I could barely hear the overhead music, and as soon as I started my own song I couldn't hear it at all. The transparency also works pretty well. It sounds a little ""tinnier"" than the Sony, but seems a bit more sensitive. Wearing them around the office I could hear everyone well.Some folks have complained about the lack of padding on the headband, but I've been wearing them for 3 hours and barely notice the headband. To be fair, I do have a lot of hair, and might be a problem if you're bald. They stay in place well, even at the gym, but I have a pretty big head.In conclusion, these are a terrific purchase that I can highly recommend. the Sonys are also completely worth it, but these Soundcore headphones are serious competitors.Update 5/8/2023:Holy Crap! They just made these even better. Latest firmware upgrade added the HearID! This is one of the features on the Liberty 3 pro earbuds (which I also LOVE) which makes them sound so good. I updated the firmware, did the hearing test and my God what a difference. I A-B tested with the XM4s and the Soundcores are clearly better. I may be able to tweak the Sonys to sound the same, but the HearID addition makes these cans an even better value. Might switch the Sonys to be my office headphone and use these as my ""main duty"" headphones.

R3F4NTDVP5DAT3,B0B5VHRX7F,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good Comfort, Terrible Sound Quality, Amazing Noise Cancelling (ANC)",James,2,"When looking for headphones on the internet (especially wireless) you are bound to hear about how great these are. these ""professional"" reviewers on sites such as YouTube and even RTINGS boast about how great these are, even comparing them to headphones triple the price, even here on the amazon reviews all you read is positive reviews. From the looks of it these headphones are the best headphones, but are they? Today that is what we are going to find out!After reading all of the great things about these headphones I wanted to purchase a pair for traveling and listening to music when I'm not at my desk. My daily driver headphones are the Audio Technica M40x they are a great pair of headphones with fantastic sound quality but I thought the Q45s would be great for plane flights and things of that sort since the ATH M40x have a long cable(1 Meter long) which makes them difficult and cumbersome to use on-the-go. So I placed an order for the glorious Q45s and eagerly awaited them to grace my household with their (alleged) glory.A little less than a week after I ordered them, they finally arrived. I excitedly open them, knowing that I was about to experience their glorious ""High-Res Audio WIRELESS"" and ""INCREDIBLE SOUND LOVED BY 20 MILLION+ PEOPLE"". I eagerly bestow them upon my head, connect them to my Android device, download the companion app(which is totally not spy-ware), load my favorite band, ""REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"", and activate the music!The Innovative Double-Layer Diaphragm Drivers have been activated! I then realised my music sounded like it was being played out of a 20$ speaker, and I was being submerged under a Motel 6 pool...okay, this is not ""Hi-Res Audio WIRELESS"", No need to fret! maybe the volume just needs to be increased. I then realize that the volume is already set at maximum. This is just how these sound. NO! This is not what the reviewers promised! They claimed the audio quality is best in class, This is WORST IN CLASS AUDIO!My ATH-M40x which are significantly lower cost then these ""Premium"" pair of headphones have at least triple the volume(loudness) and the sound quality is much better. Why do all the reviewers love the Q45s? The sound quality is TERRIBLE. Though I must concede that the Q45s are very comfortable and the ANC is great! When I activate ""NOISE CANCELLING REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"" the noise does really get reduced by at least 98%, maybe a little more. with the ""NOISE CANCELLING REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"" active I can't hear the rumble of my very loud A/C. I am impressed by everything BUT the sound quality. Even the build quality is decent!Though unfortunately, they fail at their primary function as headphones, that is to produce quality sound. I was not exaggerating earlier when describing the sound. the sound is very muddy but somehow also very echo-y sounding. The Q45s also fail at producing sound at a reasonable volume. The volume of the Q45s is less than 20% of my ATH M40x. To be fair to Anker, I do use an amplifier when operating my M40x, But on the contrary the amplifier I use is not powerful at all. Maybe very low volumes is normal with wireless headphones(?) this is my first pair of wireless headphones so I am not entirely sure. But that's besides the point.It is due time I provide a conclusion to this mess... I do not recommend the Q45s. They, as stated earlier fail at their primary function of producing quality sound, however Anker has done a good job on all other aspects of this headphone. Comfortable ear-pads, decent build quality, Fantastic ANC implementation, creative design, though they do look strange when worn but I appreciate the creativity of the unusual design. These are quite a strange headphone, its like Anker spent their effort on everything but the sound quality. I do wonder why they decided to go down this route when designing them? I think Anker should just stick to making cables, they make quality cables!As for me I will attempt to return them to hopefully get my money back. I hope my review provided you with an alternative perspective on these consumer headphones. I wish you luck on your search for headphones! Before you go, I suggest considering purchasing the ATH-M40x or any other pair of wired headphones instead of these. Just beware that you may need to get an amplifier to get the full sound out of them(Don't worry, There is a lot of amplifiers to choose from here on amazon).","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2023",AHKRDBWIV7LE4VJ6V7QFEOAKCQMA,TRUE,14,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R1EXBLSQ8K99SI,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Terrific ANC headphone -but not so much for first time users,Hwang LZ,4,"Just to clarify - This would make a terrific headphones for those who had been wearing ANC headphones a long time, but for someone like me who hasn’t worn ANC headphones before and/or is sensitive to certain sound wave pressure, you might not be accustomed to wearing this, even when it’s on a “Normal mode”.But otherwise, I would definitely recommend this for those who are looking for a new ANC headphones mainly because it does give you three different modes (transparency, normal, and ANC - which not many headphones offer). The previous reviews are on-spot, so I’m not going into too much details. But I will emphasize some things here:1.) Only good for office/commute/traveling only as it does feel slightly loose when I look up and down, so this does not make a good fitness headphones in my opinion.1a.) General fit: [my head circumference is 21 inches] When I first tried it on, it does feel slightly loose but that’s because I have a small head. However, it does feel really comfortable around my ears.2.) Sound waves: This is my first time purchasing and wearing ANC headphones, so I was unaware that ANC uses specific sound waves to cancel out the background noise, so I did feel like a very mild “airplane pressure” and it did make me uncomfortable when I wear it for quite some time, even on the “Normal mode”. My mother was extremely sensitive to it as it she began to develop headaches and congestion after wearing it for a few minutes. So this is something to consider for people who are sensitive to certain sound waves. But she did agree that this was a wonderful headphone, but it just wasn’t suitable for her.Overall, this is really a good quality ANC headphones that I’ve owned so far esp at this pricing. So for those who are looking to save money on a good pair of ANC headphone that includes a travel case, this is the one.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2023",AEDM7CLLNGNZI4C4VJKSRXDY6V3A,TRUE,19,Color: BlackSize: Medium

They feel real comfortable, I have them on for hours everyday with no discomfort. I sleep with them on, and again no discomfort. The ear cushions are plush and soft. The only complaint is the headphones will fall off if I bend over too far or tilt my head much. And I have them on the smallest setting.These are loud and they leak a lot.

R2VAUABYME01ZB,B0B5VHRX7F,"5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: Company made good, Very Pleased!",Trisha,5,"Update: I must give the highest accolades to Anker Soundcore Customer Service. Knowing that I had returned the 1st set of Q45 Space headphones because I had a sound problem, Customer Services personnel persisted in resolving my problem. Now with a new set of headphones that connected flawlessly WITH NO SOUND PROBLEMS AT ALL, I now have a set of Q45 Space Headphones that I can use on calls, class and conferences. Sound quality is clear on both ends of the conversation, headphones are very comfortable wearing; have worn 8 hours with only short break. At day’s end,. battery life, after 8 hours of wear, only went from high to medium. No charge needed during interim. Range let me go downstairs an out to the street still hearing through headphone with no interruptions. When taking breaks. Headsets hang comfortably around my neck, they are light enough to be worn with C3-C5 neck injury. NO ANC complaints. What I do miss is the touch button ANC change format that I experienced on the q35, these contain a button which is a bit more difficult to navigate when wearing. So far I am very pleased with the Q45 Space. Haven’t had time to enjoy music yet and play with all features.Old: Returned headphones. I use headphones for primarily for phone call use. First attempt call could not hear caller, switched iPhone to speaker to complete call. Second attempt yielded a screeching sound heard by caller and myself, again back to iPhone speaker to complete. Perplexed at quality because I owned the Q35’s that I really liked. The mic began failing on the Q35’s at approximately a year’s duration. Thought the Q45’s would be better. WRONG!Contacts with manufacturer largest complaint is that I would receive successive emails noting that prior emails had not been. I was still receiving “try this —“ and you haven’t responded subsequent to me emailing that the headphones had been returned. I finally combined all emails activity into one and sent it again reiterating that the headphones had been returned. Second is major complaint: when an item, new, is not working, please don’t send a litany of “try this”. The problem was the sound and app was properly installed.Re comparison of Q35 and Q45, can tell you ANC activation is better on Q35, requires only touch rather than Button hunt. Q35 instantly recognizes when headphones placed on, Q45 did not. Battery life (days) and sound excellent on Q35. Me: tempted to buy another Q35 but antsy about mic problems encountered.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2023",AGDUJPVHJTST6BTT6OPH2VGXDNRA,TRUE,12,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R296X81R2E3924,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Works well but fits loose,Thanh,4,"I needed noise canceling headphones for work, so these were in the right price range. These are my first pair ever so I have nothing to compare them to. The sound is great when I play music. The noise canceling seems good enough- I can still hear voices at times but I understand these are not 100% sound proof. Plus for safety reasons I don’t mind being able to hear a bit of noise/sound. However the main thing is they fit loose on my head. I’m 5’3, not sure if my head size but just beware if you have a smaller frame or head they may be loose. For example today I walked around my kitchen with them and looked up at the cabinet to grab something and they slid off the back of my head. No issues if I’m sitting still at my desk. My husband says they fit him just fine. Overall, they work well for my purpose and I plan of keeping them.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024",AHICIOL2M4W5YTYEXBAORLS32L6Q,TRUE,2,Color: BlackSize: Medium

R261Q9H0KIJFAA,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for the price,lawrence,4,"I had the top of the line Sonys for about 2 years. The x4 model now replaced by the x5, which I just ordered today. I am returning these. These were excellent for the price, but I was so used to the Sonys. Here are the biggest differences I found. First off, noise canceling wasn't really close. I am comparing the same experiences at the same places and this is what I really missed. An example, when flying (I fly 4 to 8 times a month) I can still hear the safety announcement coming through, I use that as an example because it's always about the same volume. It also didn't fully cancel out the noise of the landscapers which drives me crazy. Crying babies on the plane and the guy in the gym talking loudly into his headset, they all come through enough to bother me. With the Sonys, I heard none of that. Part of it seemed to be the better seal on the Sonys. The foam around the ears is better. The next thing that made a difference was the controls. The Sony is a quick swipe anywhere on the outer shell, up or down (volume) front and back (advance /replay track) when working out, this is important to me. I can make the desired adjustments without occupying my hands for more than a second. No searching for the little buttons, no pushing them the wrong way. If you are doing cardio and your hands are on the equipment or even running on a treadmill, this will probably make a difference to you. The Sony was better in the comfort category also. Mostly the top head band. The Sony has more padding, you never feel the metal frame, not so with these. And lastly, the sound quality. It got close enough after tinkering with the eq and turning on some setting (I forgot the name) but it still wasn't as good as the Sony. I never adjusted the Sony EQ. Never had a problem with the sound that I wanted to adjust it. I don't know how much background noise was a factor here, but when I was relaxing just listening to the music, I noticed the difference, the Sonys just are an amazing experience. You can close your eyes and think you are in a concert hall. For the most part, working out, on the plane, listening to movies, there wasn't much difference in the sound quality. These do have better battery life, but the Sonys last all day, just not 3 days or so like these. If I never had the Sonys I would be thrilled with these. For 1/3 of the price they are 2/3rds as good. It just depends on your budget and what you want from them.","Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2023",AGDA3Q73MTCUJUHQH2Y7OHEDSB2Q,TRUE,45,Color: BlackSize: Medium

Amazon had a sale on these headphones and I decided to try them out. I am amazed by the noise cancellation. Turning on the headphones and hearing the room and background noises disappear is bliss. I could see someone just using these without music to get peace and quiet.Playing music is also great. The sound is perfect. I am partially def and having headphones and earbuds with clear sound is very important to me. Without clearness of sound words can be muffled and sounds blend together. With these headphones the music is rich and enjoyable.These headphones also pair to two devices. This was important to me. I wanted to be able to pair them to my phone and my computer. These do that perfectly. My only advice if someone does the same, you need to check which device the headphones paired with when powering on, if both devices are close by. I had a situation where they connected to my computer and I thought they connected to my phone. I see this as user error, because the product connected correctly, I just was not paying attention.I would highly recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2024",AE73RJNTFJWOUB3AZNRDE7FWGC6A,TRUE,1,Color: WhiteSize: Medium

These Space Soundcore Q45.I'ma Compare each of them From ''Best To Worse'' and then Talk about the Pros and Cons of The Space Q45 By Soundcore.The best would be Beats Mixr But! Due to the fact that you can edit your sounds to be higher On Space Q45 that is if you like High sounds like Me! This Space Q45 Does Beats the Beat Mixr!Now! If I had to Choose Between ''ATH-M50X & Beats Solo 3'' ATH-M50X WINS!... Basically, The Worst Headphones to me at least is Beats Solo 3 out of ALL! The Sounds are just lower to Me.Now Again! Beats Mixr Sounds Better Than ALL except for the Space Q45 The only complaint I have about Beats Mixr is that It can be so loud that it sounds cloggy sort of statically with No Clear Sounds!Meanwhile, The Complaint I have about the ATH-M50X is that the sound is just Low but it does sound better in a Clear way I just wish the volume could be up a little More! The Beats Solo 3 is the worst because when I first bought it brand new the noise cancellation DIDN'T EVEN WORK! PLUS THE SOUND OF THE BEATS SOLO 3 IS JUST WAY LOW! Now on to the Pros and Cons of the Space Q45!Pro: It Sounds Better than all my previous headphones 🎧 , Bluetooth is cool, and The Noise Cancellation is Awesome! I could put this on without Music Playing and Hear Nothing! like annoying air conditioning sounds and other people in my house Lol but Yeah That's a Pro!Cons: The Bad thing about these Headphones is that You do have to use an App to edit the sounds in order for them to sound better, another thing I didn’t like is that There is a Mic Button on there, and if you press it, it will only decrease the sound also if you want the loud sounds back you have to plug the charger into it in order to get those loud sounds back! I would have thought it would be better if you can just simply press the on button again on the side of the headphones to get the Loud Sounds back but No! the charger must be plugged into it if you want it to be loud again!

That's quite a rude thing to learn at 40,000 feet while asleep.They say it is to save the battery, but I have to question that. If I am in ANC and listening to nothing, shouldn't that use less battery than if I also was listening to music?

Since I don’t use them that often, I decided to invest in less expensive ones than the Bose (I previously used for 10+ years), they are a little bit heavier on your head than the Bose, but not overly noticeable and for just wearing them in five hour spurts for cross country plane rides, these are fine. My big complaint is the chemical smell and even though I have left the case wide open unzipped for many months now, the smell has not completely dissipated. Would I buy these again if I had it to do over? I’m not sure. I think the quality is fine, but I prefer the NO smell, slightly lighter weight & bulk of the previous top of the line Bose, but for twice the price?

I wanted to get a good chance to form an opinion on them before I wrote a review. So here it goes.Comfort: 9/10The ear cups are soft and squishy and easy to wear for and extended period of time even with my glasses on! No headaches from cutting of blood flow around the ears here. The headband does not press into my head even on the tightest setting, bonus for broad headed users! That said, these do slip around if you make jerking motions or look down for too long. But for the most part they stay in place.Sound: 10/10These probably have the best consumer sound. With loads of settings and presets to tweak them to your liking. Can be leveled, crisp and clean if that’s what you need. Or if you’re a bass junkie, you can boost that and rock out via their accompanying app.Battery: 10/10I use these everyday and on a single charge they last me the whole week. I use them at night while putting the baby down to tune out the crying and white noise maker so I can stay calm and collected to be the best mama without getting overwhelmed and over stimulated. And we’ll will get to the noise cancellation next.Noise Cancellation: 5/10In my opinion, for the price, this is where the headphones underperform severely for me. On the highest setting I feel like it just barely takes the edge off loud noises (baby crying, white noise machine, etc)! But for normal things like the low hums of the road, grocery store, conversations at a coffee shop it does a good job at dulling those pretty well! I have not been on a plane with these yet, but I feel like it would be meh at blocking engine noise. So yeah, for me buying these for the sole purpose of tuning out and needing ANC, these are not worth the money. When I can afford to upgrade I’m going straight for Sony.And on a side note I’d you have colored hair, DO NOT BUY WHITE.

If you are looking for very good Noise Cancelling headphone at a reasonable price, then these might be the best ones you can purchase. The noise cancelling, the features, and build quality (these are made with very high quality plastics that look and feel like metal) are all on par with top brands. In terms of sound quality and balance, these work best for me with hip-hop, reggaeton, and electronic music genres. I could not get the desired sound quality for other genres but these are just my opinions and you may think differently.

The ear cups twist, but lack the necessary pivot for the top and bottom of the ear cups to both sit correctly without some fiddling.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AF3IXK6CHYIOADQM3NNI7XRINQ6Q,TRUE,0,Color: BlueSize: Medium
R3PESOPN6HQT4T,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall Good for the Price,Colorado,4,"These had an odd ""mix"" of quality and then not as quality as hoped. For a general durable and comfortable headphone - with great battery life and simple useful functional for an great price - go for it - overall the sound could be very nice at times - but when bringing in greater volume or complex arrangements- one frequency would drown out the other. The base sounded synthesized at times - and some of the mid-range is not responsive. As noted the sound tended to blend to center and become saturated in the mid-frequencies with more complex music. I use an equalizer to create greater sound distinction, but had trouble with distortion, even in small increments of equalization, and reduction of the preamp. They are not a particularly spacious sounding headphone. I have the Soundcore (Motion) and love them - for the price - though limited in sound capacity - you take one strength over another.","Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2023",AEVLU7BGM7UXYZTMIQ2ER25BQ3MA,TRUE,12,Color: BlueSize: Medium
R3BQC9H0JCW8JP,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars comes alive with an amp.,Jeffrey Q. Huynh,5,"ANC performance is WAY better than space one and Q30/35 by a mile. So is sound qualityAs for actual sound quality, its on the narrow side(i'm used to open backs) width wise. Instrument seperation is there, very inoffensive sound and relatively balanced tonality. Punchy bass but does not dig ultra deep. Mids are a little recess and treble is there but nothing of the sound really stands out or shines, its just a ""please everyone"" sort of tuning.Volume is pretty bad, definitely not a Gym PR headphone as it slips off easy(i have a pretty big head) and worst of all best way to describe the volume on the Q45 is when compared to your typical decently loud headphone or IEM, imagine the slider stuck on 80% to prevent hearing loss levels of volume but you are actually maxed out on your phone. Very disappointing loudness with bluetooth or wired.HOWEVER. I have a qudelix 5k headphone amp. Plugged in and WOW this headphone absolutely comes alive. Even at similar volume levels you can hear deeper bass, more details in the highs and midrange is forward and lush. Crank it up and WOW every song is a banger, although i cant get higher than 80% on the qudelix without tapping out the driver. On 40% its already a tad louder than bluetooth so Its quite a lot of room left to go power wise to really get the max performance out of these headphones.for travel use the ANC bluetooth, however if you are at home or really want to do some serious music listening, GET A BLUETOOTH HEADPHONE AMP with this.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AGLGOKGG2LTES3WDL2SULNOOVUJQ,TRUE,1,Color: BlueSize: Medium
R2UY1ZIK72OYTU,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall really nice headphones but customization is a little overwhelming,stevendavid2000,4,"The quality of the sound is really good, it's a great deal I believe compared against name brand versions. I'm a little conflicted on the settings in the app, there's almost too many settings and customization. I've found myself sometimes not sure how I want the music to sound like, so I spend a lot of time changing settings.For example, I ran the sound test where it asks you to pick between A or B versions of the same clip. I found myself picking a more compressed and brighter sound, because I originally thought that's what I like, but I'm not sure if that is the correct choice. How do I know I'm listening to music how the artist originally wanted me to listen to it? Do my choices override the artist's mastering? So while I really like the control and customization, sometimes I feel like it's too much and I spend more time tweaking settings than enjoying the actual music.Also my head is big and while they fit really well, but they certainly cause fatigue after about 30min-1hr and I need to remove them. Maybe they'll break in after I wear them more.The noise suppression is also very good when I use them at work. Sometimes I use them with no music just to block out sounds.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AHQQVVMOZWFD54RORFNGDWLQYDHA,TRUE,5,Color: BlackSize: Medium

The noise cancelling is perfectly suitable for my needs - my housemate is a life coach and I work a really cerebral tech job so not having to hear her talk on the phone is excellent. It's apparently so good that I scream if I am wearing them and don't realize it lol...Not that it matters all that much but I do love the blue color.My ONLY beef with them - and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - is that they are slightly large. I have a small head and I feel like my last pair fit better than these, which feel a bit loose when at their smallest.

R1AC58E4VI0C2P,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Music to my ears!,DDAY,5,"I just received these Sennheiser Momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago. I bought them for $270, and now I see you can get them $20 less. I made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on Amazon simply because I have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. Such as often times when it comes to Bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. In my case, that was the case. The firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and I was off and running. I have owned, and sold several headsets, from JBL, Beats, SkullCandy, Sony and yes, Bose. Now, for me, and how I like my music to sound, the Sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding Bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. Mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. Wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! The lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. The Sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. Touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. Yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. Comfort. These cans are extremely comfortable. Even for my large head. Ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. Could it use more cushion? Maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. Weight. Yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! The cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. And that is something I can appreciate. Are these cans perfect? They are as close to perfect that you will get (IMHO) on Bluetooth headsets. Are there better cans out there? Sure, If you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. Even Sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. Of course they will sound better.One thing I didn't discuss is noise canceling. They get the job done in fine fashion. I have tried the Sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the Senn 4s. I have made several phones calls, FaceTime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! I am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how I sound, or, how the other end sounds. Lastly, battery life. It claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. That is a fact, as I have tested that claim and 59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge. Mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.Accessories. Well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. You will need a dongle (I purchased one from Amazon) and they sound great. It will sound different, and you may need to adjust you equalizer. The case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type C cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to movies or music that the plane is playing. And it all is neatly stored within the case.Final thoughts:I honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on Amazon is these headsets have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. Perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? Not sure, all I know is mine cans fired right up, and I did the update straight away. These cans have Bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. Yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. Much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. It may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle, but once you do, it's a piece of cake.I decided to take a chance, I did my research outside of Amazon reviews, and watched the pros on YouTube, and that's how I ended up buying these. Big risk considering I am a world away. Give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AFGWGUIMRTG4L3M52MRY7QDFRDIQ,TRUE,4,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1FU9D18YOSOS6,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Ignore the complaints, these are the best.",MA Stewart,5,"Let me say upfront I am a long-time audiophile. I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones. Until recently, I've avoided all BT/wireless headphones because they presented too much compromise for my tastes. Noise cancellation adversely effected audio quality and/or gave me a headache. Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.Here's what I found:In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s.

R1IVGTBWY7A3K4,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars First Sennheiser purchase, highly impressed!",Shara Simpson,5,"I obsessively researched before buying these Sennheiser Momentum 4s. I had it narrowed down to Bose QC Ultras, Sony WH-1000XM5s, or these. Ultimately it came down to sound quality for me. The quality and clarity of any music genre I tested it with was far and away superior to Sony or Bose. These don't have the absolute best ANC compared to those, but it's still top tier. If you are looking for a fully immersive, lost in the music type of experience with your headphones, Sennheiser is the way to go. And the battery life is absolutely insane! I've had these for 3 weeks with almost daily use (at least an hour a day but usually more) and I haven't had to charge them at all since the first initial charge - they are still sitting at 40%! Sennheiser says they should last 60 hours with ANC at half volume and that seems accurate. No other headphones come close to that kind of battery life. I really love the Sennheiser app as well, it's packed full of useful features. The EQ on these is fully adjustable using the app. I used the ""My Sound Check"" feature and created sound profiles for various genres of music and places of use, but you can also manually adjust the 5-band EQ. You can save each sound profile and even use the Sound Zone feature to have the headphones automatically switch to a different sound profile based on your location (ex. gym settings versus work settings). There is also a Bass Boost toggle if you want head pounding bass. I really like the two-tone look of these - I got them in white, but the headband is covered in a very nice textured tan fabric and the earcups are tan as well. They are extremely comfortable for hours of use at a time. The case is super sturdy and nice. I put a size comparison pic in this review with the case next to my Kindle - the case is large since the headphones don't fold. This makes them less than ideal for use when traveling because they do take up a lot of space in your bag. The first week of use, I did have connection issues. They would randomly disconnect from whatever music streaming service I was using at the time and I would have to reconnect. Thankfully that went away and I haven't had any further connectivity problems. I don't use these for phone calls so can't review the mic or call quality yet. Overall I think I made the right choice with these, and am extremely happy with my purchase.

R2CIT7PKP36F3M,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound quality, great battery life. Noise cancellation is OK. Updates could make it 5/5.",Amazon Customer,4,"Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones & headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what ""Comfort calling"" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous ""Connected/Disconnected"" messages while listening on a different device.Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGUYYNC6G5RGNFL4HD6LXEB6JJCA,TRUE,31,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R27AA754NCZRA9,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good on paper, bad on my head",Sam,3,"I was going back and forth between Sony WH-1000XM5 (XM5) and these headphones (SM4), and I decided to give these a shot since at the time of this purchase, I was able to get these for $279.83 before taxes while the XM5 are listed at ~$400 before taxes.On paper, the SM4 sounded great, double the battery life, supposedly better sound quality, and a not-so-shabby noise cancelling.However, after trying them for a week, I decided to return them. I will list the pros and cons below.PROS 1. Long battery life – I only charged it once during the whole week and it was still going strong. 2. Very solid construction – premium materials that feel good to the touch. 3. Pretty nice carrying case – feels solid and durable, and you don't need to fold the headphones when you put it in so it's simpler to stow in case. BUT I have to reset the positions of the earcups to fit into case, which means I have to always re-adjust to my head size before putting it on. 4. Great sound – I'm not an audiophile, but it sounded good. A friend said he picked up on more chords behind a Taylor Swift song that he hasn't heard before (he listens to Taylor Swift 24/7). 5. Sleek design – unlike the SM3, the SM4 has design that I like: minimalistic and modern.CONS 1. Subpar app-headphone interface – the app is glitchy, and I find myself wait around 10 seconds for the app to say ""connected"" to the headphones (even though the headphones are connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth); after which point, I can go in and change some settings. Also, I did have some stutters in the app that gave me an overall feel of unpolished. 2. Too heavy and too much clamping force – on paper, the weight and clamping force differs by 0.1-ish, but from trying out my friends' XM5s and my SM4, I feel a pretty noticeable difference in how hefty the headphones feel on my head. Simply put, SM4 feels tight on my head and XM5 feels like I can forget that I’m wearing them after a while—this is personal preference, but personally, SM4 felt less comfortable and a tad too heavy for long study sessions. 3. Headache-inducing noise cancelling – the noise cancel isn't as good as the XM5 indeed, but I think there is a bigger problem: the noise cancelling feels peculiarly headache-y. I have airpod pros, plus I have tried the XM5s, and I have to say, the SM4's noise cancelling is by far my least favorite. If I were to describe it, I would say it feels like the feeling I get from being on an airplane for 5+ hours with headphones on. All in all, I opted to have no noise cancelling on due to this uncomfortable feeling it gives me. 4. Touch control – the touch control is pretty responsive, but even if I touch the very edge of the earcups, it registers as a gesture, which gets annoying when I'm trying to adjust my headphones or taking them off for a second. After a few days, I almost wanted to turn them off. ALSO, XM5's cupping gesture to activate transparency mode is extremely desirable, especially since I'm a college student who finds myself studying with my friends a lot. AND the SM4 does not have a gesture to turn off noise cancelling; I have to either pinch in/out multiple times or go into the app and adjust the slider, and it gets very annoying quick.If you have read this far, I applaud your diligence to find the best headphones for you. Personally, I have ordered the XM5 and I will try it on and probably keep it. BUT, an advise for you if you are like me. I dug through the internet and have looked at countless written, video, and professional reviews of so many headphones, but I have to say, it all comes down to personal preference. You MUST go to a Best Buy, where they have headphones on racks that you can try on for yourself. Also, don’t be afraid to order them on amazon and try it out for a week and return them and move onto the next one. Amazon’s return policy is pretty good and if you use the headphones with care and keep the packaging that the headphones came in, you can most likely return them for free. I hope you find the right pair of headphones for yourself, reader.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2023",AE4ZGTN75KVUPUK7VO5OXU4BKWJA,TRUE,119,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3C9NCI2LLQD48,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser vs Sony vs Apple,Calder Akin,5,"After watching countless hours of review videos and sampling multiple headphones firsthand I narrowed my final selections down to the Momentum 4’s ($280 currently on Amazon), and a pair of certified refurbished (eBay) AirPod Max’s ($390) and Sony Xm5’s ($280). My budget was under $400. I also considered the Bowers & wilkins px7 s2 but didn’t have a chance to try them out firsthand so I excluded them from my selection process.Ultimately I decided to go with the Sennheisers. To me the Sonys are the most comfortable (so light, it’s as if there’s nothing on your head!) but the ear-cup itself is the shallowest of the three- my ears stick out a little so this was a consideration. Also, I have an iPhone and many reviews said the audio was better on the XM5’s when connected to androids due to the Ldac etc. The Apples sound the best when it comes to immersive experience (spacial audio wow!) but the limited EQ flexibility, and the extra money I’d have to spend on a real case plus wires to plug into a jack when flying outweighed (no pun intended- but these things ARE heavy!) the luxury feel.The Momentum 4’s (M4) are very comfortable with plush faux leather on the ear cups. I wish they were a bit bigger of an oval shape (something to consider if you have big ears) but for me they fit just right. The ear cup has more substantial padding and recesses slightly deeper than the Sonys over the ear. All three of these headphones have the same sliding headband design which I really like.Where the M4’s really shine however is in the audio department. It just sounds so clean in my opinion. I own a pair of Beats Studio 3’s which are my go-to gym headphones. You don’t get a “pounding” heavy sound with the M4’s like you do with the Beats but that’s fine with me. They also don’t get as loud as my Beats but I didn’t buy them for either of these reasons. I wanted a pair of headphones for traveling, taking the dog for a walk, and listening to music/tv around the house. Speaking of watching TV with them, there’s an EQ preset through the app which is designed for podcasts. I set the headphones to this feature the other night while watching a basketball game and it sounded amazing! Also there’s this cool feature for phone calls which you can adjust through the app where it sounds like you aren’t wearing headphones and you can hear your own voice clearly - muffled sounding phone calls are a thing of the past!Overall I’m incredibly happy with my purchase. They aren’t quite as comfortable as the Sony’s- it’s not that they’re uncomfortable it’s just they have more weight to them and more of a clamp on the head. And they don’t have the seamless syncing ability and build quality of the Apples. Also, their noise cancelling and transparency mode is slightly below both. But for the price and sound quality these were the best fit for me.Pros:* price ($279 on Amazon currently which is around $70 below retail)* Clean, pure audio that sounds good regardless of your favorite genre of music.* Comfort- plush pads with ample space for my ears to be enclosed. Easily adjustable sliding headband.* Rigid case (slightly smaller than the XM5’s)* Battery life (60 hours!)* Auto-off feature when taken off and not used for 15 minutes or more depending on how you set it (great if you often forget to turn off your headphones!)* Easy to navigate app. I know some have complained about the app but I’ve had zero issues with it- maybe the firmware has been fixed with the most recent update?* No noticeable hissing sound with ANC.* 2 year manufacturers warranty* Usb-c and traditional 3.5mm connectivity. Also they come included with a two-prong airplane jack.Cons:* I appreciate the creativity making most of the functions of the headphones accessible via touchpad on the right ear-cup, but the pinching/expanding feature to adjust ANC/transparency is useless. Thankfully you can just double tap the headset to switch between these settings.* They don’t get super loud, well at least compared to my Beats, so I wouldn’t consider these a great gym option. (Edit: there’s a thread on Reddit that gives some pointers on how to increase the overall volume- especially if you have an iphone. Worth checking out, the adjustments I made did seem to work)* They aren’t water/sweat resistant, which is another reason not to wear them to the gym.* ANC is effective but not on the level of the Sonys or Apples.* The auto pause feature is pretty sensitive. Something to keep in mind if you adjust your headphones often during usage. If you lift them off your head, even to just change position the audio can unintentionally pause. (Edit: there’s a way to turn off this function in the app)TLDR; Best Bluetooth noise cancelling over ear headphones currently available.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2023",AGGIZAHMHFHO4J6OU7FMAHUD4MMA,TRUE,154,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RQ0W5FUGCFR5X,B0B6GHW1SX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, bad UX Design.",Cacho K,2,"The PXC-550 headphones were my go-to for the past three years, striking the perfect balance between quality sound and comfort, with just a couple of drawbacks: a lack of USB-C support and less-than-ideal battery life. Eager for an upgrade, I transitioned to their successor MOMENTUM, hoping for improvements. On paper, the new model seemed to promise just that—a better, more refined listening experience. However, while the upgrade delivered in some areas, it faltered in others, revealing design flaws that the PXC-550 had already mastered.On the plus side, the sound quality is exceptional, with noise cancellation that effectively silences the outside world, and a battery life that feels almost endless. These improvements alone make the headphones a significant leap forward.But not all changes are for the better. The new design is bulkier. More frustratingly, the intuitive fold-to-turn-off (and on) feature of the PXC-550 has been omitted. The satisfying click of the folding switch, which once brought a sudden moment of reassurance—a Deus ex Machina moment between you and this piece of machinery—is gone. Now, turning off the headphones requires holding down a button for an awkwardly long pause, a process that can accidentally trigger pairing mode instead of powering down. This seemingly small change significantly impacts the user experience, transforming seamless transitions into moments of annoyance.Imagine this: You're about to start your car journey, only to discover your headphones have remained on, constantly attempting to connect to your phone, disrupting the peace of your drive. Or picture yourself at your desk, a sudden visitor arrives, and you're caught in an awkward dance of trying to turn off your headphones, a delay that interrupts the flow of life.This shift from the elegantly simple act of folding your headphones to turn them off and on to a cumbersome, button-dependent process adds up, not just in seconds wasted but in the sheer inconvenience it represents, especially when you know how effortless it once was. The PXC-550 made life smoother, akin to having a trusted steed by your side in the relentless battle of daily existence—a companion so reliable, its absence is profoundly felt.In light of these experiences, one can't help but yearn for a simple solution: a PXC-550 reimagined with USB-C. Such a proposition seems a minor ask for the return of what was lost—the instant gratification and reassurance of effortlessly powering down by folding, a feature that made the PXC-550 an indispensable part of life's arsenal.One could say that the new headphones, while technologically superior, miss the mark on understanding the rhythm of life. The joy of technology is not just in its capability but in its ability to blend seamlessly into our lives, enhancing without complicating. The previous model understood this, becoming more than just a tool for listening—it was a companion in the epic battle of everyday life.As it stands, despite its technological strides, the newer model leaves something to be desired for those of us who cherish both the journey and the simplicity of interaction with our gadgets. In essence, the quest for improvement should not forsake the intuitive pleasures of the past.Btw 80 seconds a day with this button nonsense, equals to 8 hours a years of frustration.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AF3JMHEBBABMCAMCXQHQBEXC2ONQ,TRUE,2,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3HDZ4YGKNQ6L5,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Great Sound + Connection Problems + Poor touch controls,Ryan,3,"I just got these headphone. I really like how they feel and sound. The problem I have with these headphones is largely related to its bluetooth features and controls. I have these headphones connected to my phone and my TV. I live in an apartment. As such, these headphones constantly get confused between which bluetooth source to connect to. The result is choppy, broken audio or no audio at all and problems with touch controls.When its my phone's audio that's choppy the solution is to disconnect the tv using the headphone app. However, shortly after disconnecting the tv, the tv reconnects on its own and the problem returns. When its the TV audio that choppy, I have to turn off bluetooth on my phone completely to solve the problem. This again is due to the headphones automatically connecting to the unwanted source.The controls for this headphone are wonky to say the least and often don't work. For example, I will answer a phone call with a touch control but then can't end the phone call with a touch control. Another example is that I can't start or resume playing Spotify on my phone using touch controls. But while the music is playing I can pause, skip, or change the volume. I think some of these problems may be due to the headphones connecting to my tv at the same time. I suspect that my attempts to play or resume music are being sent to my TV (which is off) and not to my phone.The headphone's app is largely useless for attempting to solve these problems. The likely solution to all of these problems is to 'forget' my tv. Meaning, everytime I want to connect my headphones to my tv I would have to pair them with my tv. At this point, I'm likely to return these headphones due to all of these problems.To put all of the above in perspective. I have a pair of Pixel earbuds and I experience none of the above problems.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AF4KKUJCDDGW4ZZLQN23QJMOYFCQ,TRUE,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
R38QYC50V9S55Y,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Winner of my search for headphones,Chip chipperson,5,"I wanted to find a really good set of over the ear headphones to use at the office and for general use. I tried a few other highly rated models at varying price points. The momentum 4 was the winner for me. I had been using Beats Studio noise canceling earbuds and before that a pair of beats special edition solos. The solos hurt my ears after 2 hours, while the earbuds were great, but they just don’t last long enough for my current work environment without having to charge. Additionally, the earbuds had bad sound wuality for the microphones so they weren’t ideal for phone and teams calls.I orders the sennheiser as my higher end option to evaluate. At first I was a little skeptical of they were going to be the ones. I found that just pairing them to my iPhone worked and was easy, but it did t allow me to use the sennheiser app. I cleared them from my phones Bluetooth lost and paired again using the app, and all was good. The app offers a pretty decent amount of customization and guides you through it. I think the app works well once you get it all configured correctly. There are other headphones on the market that will really rattle your head with bass such as the beats and some of the skullcandy headphones. I found that I don’t care for those headphones when I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks, they are just too tuned for music with deep and solid bass. The momentum 4 delivers some very tight and punch bass. I can’t say I’m wow’d by the bass I get for every track I listen to, but when I get into a bass heavy track or album, I find myself completely wow’d by the performance and range of these momentum 4’s. I believe these are a truer representation of how most songs are actually recorded. The clarity, crisp, clean, tight, punchy, deep, and full sound from these headphones is fantastic. I think my podcasts sound great, music sounds awesome, across a very wide variety of genres. The clarity of my voice in a loud office setting to take phone calls and teams calls is great. The noise canceling is always on unless you adjust to transparency to some degree, and I would have expected this to hinder battery life, but these do a great job canceling ambient noise and fully live up to the claims of 60plus hours of use between charges.I wear these at a minimum 6 hours a day, sometimes as much as 10. They actually keep a connection far better than I expected. I have these paired to my work pc and my iPhone at the same time and can get up and move around our office and leave devices at my desk and never lose connection. While connected to two devices it does a good job seamlessly transitioning from one device to the other based on what apps or programs you are running.Last thing I can think to comment on are the headphone controls. The right earpiece is a touch sensitive pad that picks up on specific but very intuitive gestures. Pausing music, changing tracks, adjusting ANC and transparency, and volume is super easy. The only one of these I think is a little touchy is the volume control, which works fine but it seems a little inconsistent as to how much it adjusts each time. I’ve never had a situation where it was too sensitive and blasted me with sound unexpectedly.Overall, I do recommend these for the money. Like mine so well, I bought a pair for my wife as she was so impressed with mine as well.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AEHRRPY3SLGEJSCWGWWY75QNAMUQ,TRUE,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3CBBVTHO6OEW6,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love these...,Joe,3,"I own another pair of Sennheiser headphones, the 598SE's, and they're spectacular. They're spacious, clear, wonderful sound stage, light, and powerful.After trying a few other brands of ANC headphones, I learned about the Momentum 4's and immediately thought: OK, Sennheiser is gonna knock it out of the park.Unfortunately, they only got to first base.First, the good:I love how these look, especially the copper accented special edition's that I got. The fabric on the top of the headband makes it look classy.The sound is wonderful. Absolutely the best thing about this product. The sound stage compared to the other major competitors is still a step above.The carrying case is nice, roughly the same size as their competitors. I did wish it could have been a bit smaller (this goes for the competitors too).The swipe controls are the same as a major competitor, which you can also lock. I really like the swipe controls, though having physical buttons would be nice too, especially if you lock the swipe controls.The battery life is beyond spectacular. It destroys their competition and you could probably wear these for several days without needing a charge.Now, the bad:They're quite heavy. The weight on paper seems like they'd be fine, but while wearing them I quickly got fatigued and felt frustrated wearing them (while their competitors, it took much longer to get to that point).They get hot. Not the headset itself, but they form a seal on your head and you'll feel your ears cooking after a short while in a comfortable temperature room. This was another reason I frequently took them off.The earcups are small. They seem EVER SO SLIGHTLY larger than their competitors but... not enough. The 598SE's have big beautiful spacious earcups but these (and their competitors) are very cramped.The ANC is notably weaker in a perfect environment without noise playing than others. With others, I could barely make out any words while playing a song or video rather loud as a test. With the Sennheisers I could make out quite a bit of words and sound. The Momentum 4's have fewer ANC microphones than the competitors.The ANC also almost drops out completely if you have ""windy environment mode"" turned on, for some reason. (Note: I did not test them in a windy environment) If the ANC is important, make sure you have this setting *TURNED OFF* in the app.The app is ok, but what you can ""control"" seems finicky and sometimes its as if changing settings did nothing.The call volume is like 5 generations ago hands-free headset. Very poor quality. The person I tested them with said it sounded like I was outdoors or in a noisy environment when I was in a quiet room.The clamping is quite tight and becomes painful very quickly. It puts a lot of pressure around your ear which can become very uncomfortable. A friend said they loosen up after a couple days but mine stayed far too tight. It felt like a vice. [If it doesnt bother you, this could be a plus, as they seem like they will hold their shape and tightness for a long time]Even lacking almost any physical buttons, they basically threaten you to not get these wet. There is no waterproofing on these. Handle with care.The rest:These are by no means a ""bad"" set of wireless ANC cans, and the price is good, especially if you can get them on sale. If you're just going to be using them in the office or on a commute, they'll probably be fine, especially if you dont want to dole out extra cash for a minor upgrade in ANC. The middling ANC was quite disappointing, but if you have some sounds playing while its on, it works together to make most noises disappear. Unfortunately, sometimes I want to be able to just block out the world, and the Momentum 4's were just not up to the task compared to others.I was really hoping the earcups would be larger and more similar to other Sennheiser headsets I've tried/owned, but they seemed to want to copy the competition, which is a shame. If the cups were larger and the clamping a bit less harsh, I would have accepted their flaws and gone with these. With the laundry list of negatives, you can probably tell why I didnt.Also please note: I am a big guy, and I probably have a larger than average head. This could be contributing to the clamping pressure.Listening to anything on these was a treat. Everything sounded beautiful. Other brands should take a few notes on Sennheisers drivers.I had two main requirements: comfortable ear cups (failed) and long battery life for an upcoming flight (wow did these pass with not flying colors but to outerspace and back colors!). Unfortunately, as they were just not at all comfortable (I could wear my 598SE's for days and not even realize they're there). Their long battery life did not offset the negatives.This may all not be true for you. They definitely stand out and are far more attractive than the competition (at least, the special edition versions are). I am definitely biased towards Sennheiser as I have loved so many of their headsets, but found these disappointing in far too many areas. A few design tweaks could have made these one of the best over the ear cans on the market. As is, they're probably ranked 4th imho.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AHECMYUWUWYVG4EVIGA4QI6LUO4A,TRUE,6,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

Safe to say, they aren't the most noise canceling headphones you can get. So when I went looking for a new pair of wireless over-ears, I had a lot to choose from. I didn’t want sony so that was out of the question.I had whittled it down to four pairs.AirPods MaxBose Quietcomfort UltraSennheiser Momentum 4’s andSonos Ace.Now each of these had their own strengths and weaknesses.AirPods Max are realistically only compatible with apple products and have the worst battery life. However have the same sound signature as my current AirPods.Bose Quietcomfort Ultra has the best noise canceling of the bunch, but was more expensive and ultimately poor battery life.Sonos Ace is the newest one of the bunch, it has decent audio quality and an okay battery. The worst was the microphone, I did not want to have to deal with a microphone that low quality.Which brings me to the ones I went with.Momentum 4 has some of the best soundstage I’ve heard in headphones. The bass is punchy but doesn’t muddy the rest of the track. The touch controls are personally a hit or miss, I love most of them but wish I could pinch or un-pinch to turn transparency fully on or off respectively. I haven’t charged them but once, and they currently have 70% after two days of use.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHMM6BNJ762VVIBOWD4MVGAQWYVA,TRUE,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1RV286N7J32C4,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is top notch. ANC is much better than my old Sony. Battery lasts forever.,B. Carter,4,"My daily drivers at home are open ear Hifiman. I don't think any bluetooth ANC headphones will ever match that experience, but Sennheiser comes closer than any I've yet heard. It meets my needs.The noise cancellation is much stronger than my old $120 Sony headphones, and the battery lasts roughly three times as long -- upwards of 60 hours. The audio pass-through feature is also great for those times when you need to listen to your surroundings.I enjoy the style as well. The white/beige color stands out among bluetooth headphones, I think.I've only two complaints: 1) My head is on the larger size, and these are a tight fit. They do break in after awhile (I'm posting this after around 9 months of use), but they still clamp a bit too hard for my liking, and can run hot. Should not be a problem for most people, I think. But for larger headed folks, be aware of what you're getting into. I'm willing to make the compromise for headphones of this quality, though. 2) the headphones have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I find this feature isn't worthwhile. When I'm listening to music through my tablet, and I get a text alert from my phone, there's a staticky sound that just makes it not worth using. That said, I haven't had the other software issues that some users experience. As far as I can tell, Sennheiser has patched it all up -- my experience has been smooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AH2PJ2BKE72VH5SVUL7TI6ZMXXXA,TRUE,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The picture shows comparison with sony 720n. I tried Sony ULT wear (too bassy), Beats Pro (too flat sound signature), Sennheiser Accentum (good but sound quality wasnt best), Sony WH 1000 XM4 (instrument separation wasnt bes). I have Airpods pro 2 but I also wanted a headset as the sound staging of headset is better.Let me address all the cons that you might have heard from youtube influencers. All the cons like headset automatically powering on while in case, auto pause not working etc are gone with latest software update (Software rev 2.13.28)Pros:The sound of Sennheiser momentum 4 is clean with impressive instrument separation and bass that both hits and resonates. The sound staging is shockingly well. For some tracks, it feels they are being played live in front of me. The sound is loud enough for me. I keep them around 70% as I dont want to miss out on all of that intstrument separation!the case, although bigger than sony ULT wear/1000xm4 and bose QC but its not as big as sony 1000 xm5 or other headset that dont fold. Refer to the pic. Because of impressive sound, I am willing to compromise a little on the case size.Impressive ANC. The world goes super quite. I cant hear my keystrokes when I am typing, no hum of AC in the background (my home office is very close to AC unit). Touch controls are bit sensitive but its not bad. You get used to it.I purchased them at $280. So its a steal. I would not buy them at $379. They dont feel premium enough to justify $379 price tag. They do live up to $280 price tag. Not super premium, but not cheap looking by any means.60 hours battery life!The clamping force isnt as tight as its on other Sennheiser headsets like 450 BT or Accentum. Its bit tighter as compared to Sony WH 720 n though. The earcups do seems to get a little hot after a while and I have to let heat out and adjust them a little.Cons:Not perfect for travel due to big case. But I still manage.Def less comfortable than my sony wh720nIf they go on sale for $279 or lower, get them!

R246JYYUL9YOYE,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing battery life, sound quality, and ANC.",Joseph Oscar,4,"I've figured out the bug people seem to run into which is the headset does not output sound. They're onand connected but no music. In my case, it's when an app. is activated for VOIP. I'm currently using the Nextiva phone app to answer calls when I walk away from the desk and when I receive a phone call, I have to force close the app to get music rolling again. Once music is playing, I can open the app again to catch the next call. It's a buggy back and forth but I have it figured out at least. Current phone is Google Pixel 7 Pro. So if anyone else reads this, try force closing whatever secondary app you use for VOIP.I just wanted the main issue to be the first eye catcher but with the headphones working and the equalizer set from the app, these things rock. If I'm working on a car with the ANC turned on, I can barely hear the air compressor running in the background. A little but it's reduced significantly. Now the ear cup material will make you sweat if your in a warm environment so make sure your aware of that. It's not that bad really. I'm sure when it gets warmer out, it will be more noticable. Probably not a good workout headphone either. That I can't comment on. I have to many excuses to go to the gym 😅.Battery life is great. Rated 60+ hours and it definitely is there. I use my headset daily with ANC moving all over the place with whatever I'm doing and music running all kinds of volume levels. I definitely don't charge these very often but get over a week depending on usage. 4-8 hours a day thoughout the work week.Sometimes, the in ear sensor that tells when the headset is on will think I've removed the headset and turn off. I'll just have to push the right side head cup in and it will read again and turn back on. Kind of annoying but I think I need to reach out to Sennheiser about that.Fingure controls, super easy and very responsive. Once you've used the headphones a few times and read the instruction sticker that comes on the headphones, it's muscle memory from there.

RL3M28E80KTYV,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality, solid in every other area",Aaron,5,"Bought these along with the Sony XM5 to compare to my existing Bose 700.Comfort:The Bose 700 I don't find very comfortable, namely the headband, being rather thin, it puts pressure on the top of my head after a couple hours. The Sony had this problem initially, but then I started loosening the headband as much as possible, and being a very light pair, I stopped having that particular issue. All in all I found the Sony much more comfortable than the 700. I could see some folks saying it's more comfortable than the Momentum 4s. However I disagree about that. For me the Momentum 4 are the most comfortable. It has very soft ear pads, much like the Sony. Granted the M4s are heavier, but the weight is distributed very well across the headband, better than the Sony's imo. All in all, it's a close call and the Sony's are really well done comfort wise. Super light and super cushy pads. Could see a reasonable person going in either direction for the win here.Sound quality:I think the XM5 are pretty close to the Bose 700 and could see folks going either way depending on your signature preferences. Personally think I like the Sony a bit better, just more lively than the more neutral Bose. Both are in the same league though. The M4s are way better sound quality wise plain and simple. They're not in the same league. Heck, they're not even playing in the same sport. Find myself listening to music way more often during the day simply because I enjoy it that much more. This is the reason I'm ultimately sticking with the M4s. And it's not a hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 are simply the best. If you're buying headphones to block out the sound of your partner playing annoying tiktok vids, this is the one to get. M4s have pretty good noise canceling too, but the Sony's are way better here imo. Bose sits between the XM5 and the M4s, maybe just a little better than the M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely with multiple meetings throughout the day so I've done extensive testing on all three models. In a nutshell if you don't have any special requirements, all of them do a great job. In quiet conditions I prefer the the M4 a little better than the others, my voice just has more body to it, but again, it's plenty clear using any of these models. In noisy conditions, the Sony XM5 are way better than the rest in isolating your voice and minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! The 700 and M4 handled the background noise a bit differently. My voice is clearer on the M4s in noisy conditions whereas the Bose cancel out more background noise at the cost of sacrificing clarity. When there's lots of noise, the Bose can reduce your voice to the point where it's super difficult to hear what you're saying. The M4s will allow more background noise through, but my voice remains super clear and louder than other sounds coming through.One feature I really like about the M4s, the one and only button they have (making it super easy to find) becomes a mute button during calls, zoom or google meetings. Really enjoy that feature as I could walk around the house and unmute myself if I need to talk. A voice tells you if it's muted or unmuted so you know where you're at. No more flushing the toilet while running out of the room hoping no-one on the meeting heard it.The background noise canceling of the XM5 during calls was so good, it made me really want to keep them. But ultimately good music sound quality is something I'd enjoy more often since I'm not often taking meetings in super noisy conditions. Also the M4s have the mute button I could use if I do find myself in that situation.Summery:If you want incredible noise cancelation while listening to music, taking calls or meetings, the Sony XM5 are the one to get. They are head and shoulders above the competition in this respect. If you wanna be wowed by how amazing your music sounds, renewing your love for music you didn't even know you had, the M4s are for you. These are the main areas where there is substantial difference. Sony and Seinheiser truly impressed me in their respective areas of expertise. Aside from those standout areas, these are all great headsets. Even the Bose 700 is a really solid headset. Unfortunately it wasn't able to differentiate itself when compared to these two titans of industry. Noise canceling is great, just can't touch the Sony's. Sound quality also great, just can't touch the M4s. Arguable the Bose are the slickest looking headset of the bunch though.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AEIK33PCH7JB7R3OI4CZJZPPNLDQ,TRUE,88,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

RQIJ8796C2B2A,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Sound is top notch,NerdyCup,4,"TLDR; great sound with pretty good ANC.First, I'm not an audiophile. I appreciate music and sound more than just ""MOAR BASS"" but as to warmth, tonality, and terms like that, I'm lost. I do know having worn open back headphones those have a great sound space compared to closed back, but my wife can't stand hearing my music so it's closed back headphones for me.Positive:1. Great sound. Between these, some Senns 598s, true momentum earbuds, I've never not liked the sound Sennheiser produces. Earbuds were the weakest, but those were Momentum 2s and didn't last long when my dogs chewed on them (I understand Sennheiser has improved as well).1A. I cannot understate how good these sound - I literally can hear Chester Bennington pushing his breath out on ""Lost"", and instruments I've never picked up before. I can't recall other headsets doing that for me.2. Comfortable - immediately comfortable out of the box. Maybe warms up my ears a bit much, but the benefit is a solidly closed ""box"" for my ears to listen without distraction.3. Battery life appears to be as epic as they say it is. I haven't rocked it solid for 50+ hours to find out but I've charged it like once, when I first got it a few weeks ago (not constantly listening)Unknowns: need to test the ANC on an airplane/airport setting, which is my biggest pet peeve for noise environments. Will try to update (if I remember) once I do.Negatives:1. Touch controls in general. It's not just Sennheiser, but Sony and others im sure. I just don't really want to take the time to remember if it's a swipe, pinch, double-triple-quad tap to do something. KISS should be the rule of thumb. I can stumble through by tapping/swiping either side and eventually find something close to what I want, but I usually end up in the Sennheiser Smart Control App to make sure the ANC is what I want.Comparison:I also got a Sony WH-1000XM5 recently. Also a very good headphone, but the sound is absolutely not as good as Sennheiser. ANC is top of class though (although I also have t tried it in an airport/airplane, just in my commutes), and is better than Sennheiser, it's not as huge a gap as it used to be. We're comparing a Porsche and a BMW; should anyone turn either of them down? No.It comes down to your personal needs: lots of travel(air, train, whatever) in noisy environments? Maybe go with Sony, but I'd try the Sennheiser Momentum 4s first to see if their ANC works for you. IMO, the Sennheiser sound quality is much better than Sony's sound more than Sony's ANC is better than Sennheiser's.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGX5BT3OBJ4RMSQM7TVVOBQTPU4Q,TRUE,4,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

Comparing it to earbuds, it’s a completely different experience. The sound is not so much in your ear it’s more of a surround sound (not a complaint just something to remember when buying headphones) Overall I’m happy with my purchase and will be using them daily… I just can’t get over how much I paid for it to not include a charging block.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AFZZAFFPXS47JMV2SV6VSLEISZZQ,TRUE,6,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3V8FW19HBYSG7,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't touch them or they'll try to connect to everything,Customer Since 1997,3,"These headphones must have some kind of tilt sensor or other mechanism to know when they have been moved. If I am not using them and I accidentally touch them or they get bumped and move even slightly, they will suddenly try to connect to every device they are paired with, cutting off the sound from a random device I'm not currently using them with. They also seem to just randomly connect themselves to any device that is playing audio, cutting off the sound so that I have to go to that Bluetooth device's settings and disconnect them to get sound back. Very annoying.That aside, these are what I would call 'average' headphones. They're your typical V-shaped consumer sound that you'd get from any other dynamic headphone. They're bass heavy because your average consumer equates more base with more quality.Their noise cancellation is not particularly good. They seem to slightly lower the volume of some noises. In the areas where other noise canceling headphones excel such as repetitive or droning noises, these headphones seem to not work at all. For example, when I'm a passenger in a car I can clearly hear the noise of the air conditioner with the noise cancellation maxed out.There's also a problem with the touch surface on the earcup. I have turned off the touch features several times but they keep turning themselves back on. Every time I touch my face to scratch an itch or brush my hair out of my face I hear a PLOK and a random setting on the headphones has changed itself as if I have interacted with them. I have to dig my phone out in the middle of my exercise, figure out which setting was changed, and change it back.That's not to say that these headphones are all bad: I have tried many of the headphones in the ""fancy wireless headphones with noise canceling"" category over the years, and I'd have to say that in terms of comfort, these are the best. I can wear them for hours while exercising with minimal discomfort.That said, they do have some rattling and creaking issues that I would not expect at this price point. There's an unusual amount of plastic material on these headphones that I would not expect on a premium noise canceling headphone. While other brands are using lovely brushed aluminum supports for the earcups, these headphones have stuck with the creaky plastic with clearly visible mold lines.To summarize, I would say that these headphones are sort of the odd person out: They do not excel at anything, but they are not particularly bad at anything, either. Senheiser seems to have targeted to produce a headphone that provides middle-of-the-road performance in all areas, and in that capacity they have succeeded.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AER3H6YXKFEFRVUVRRMSWOQFE42A,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Firstly, the connection gets choppy sometimes, and I don't know why. It often requires restarting the headset to fix. Another issue is that the quietest volume is not quiet enough. Listening to music in bed at night, it's just too loud in such an otherwise quiet environment. Also the auto-off/wake feature is way too sensitive. I'll leave it on my desk, come back later, and just bumping the desk makes it turn back on which often I don't want. Also if I manually disconnect the headset BT connection from my phone, the headset will just reconnect after a few seconds which is really annoying.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AEL3ADX56NWIHHUCZKWI7N6FDU5Q,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2U81MBUB3SIOG,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Momentum 4 vs. everything else,AC,5,"Note:I am a trained listener - first as a former musician, second as an engineer, and lastly as a military operator.Devices used for testing/review:Samsung S22 Ultra (*disclaimer: Samsung owns Harman/AKG/etc., so their audio software is well above average)iPhone 12 Pro MaxApple Airpods MaxDragonfly Cobalt + USB C connector (for the wired headphones)Grado RS2eBeyerdynamic T1 v2Random air purifier on maxMusic tested:Houkiboshi by Younha (vocal, piano, guitar J-Pop song/anime soundtrack)Flash by Rocket Punch (standard K-Pop song)The The by Rocket Punch (dance K-Pop song)Wow by DIA ('new-retro' K-Pop song)Design overview:1. I purposely bought the white model - very clean/modern look, but perhaps a little too minimalistic. Also looks like many other competing wireless headphones ><.2. A little on the small side. I have fairly average-sized ears, and the earcups barely cover the lobes, which is great for passive noise cancellation, but I did have to adjust the headband quite a bit. In comparison, the Airpods have a self-adjusting system similar to my wired AKG K712 i.e., the headband will adjust to your head size.3. Plasticky compared to the Apple's metal frame. It's kind of like my AKG vs. my Beyerdynamic. In terms of build quality feel, 'you get what you pay for'.Comfort:1. Earpads: this is what most travelers will care about. Like with any headphone, I adamantly recommend everyone review manufacturer site, legitimate review sites, etc. The Sennheiser M4 has pleather pads as you can tell. No need to say that they'll get hot after a while - common knowledge. Grado loses here for obvious reasons, then the Sennheiser, then the Beyerdynamic, and finally the winner the Airpods. Apple was smart in using mesh - breathable and lightweight.2. Headband: this is not as big a deal as earpads. None of the test headphones were terrible, but some were still better than others. The Sennheiser uses a medium with pleather band covered by fabric, which looks nice. In a huge switcheroo, Grado wins with their thin industrial band, followed by Apple's thin metal, then the Sennheiser, and finally the Beyerdynamic with their high-end but a little too thick leather curve.Sound and Noise cancellation:1. Obviously, a wired headphone connected to a top end USB DAC will beat any wireless one, but both the Apple and Sennheiser did well here. And they still cost less than the Beyerdynamic to boot.2. Neither wired headphones are noise cancelling nor do they claim to be, but being semi-closed/open, you would think the Beyerdynamic might do ok, but no joy.3. Both the Apple and Sennheiser are very good at noise cancellation, but not perfect, but the Apple was clearly better, even with all Sennheiser settings at max.Accessories:1. This is a fun one. Apple being Apple, gives you jack (no pun intended). An USB C to Lightning cable, infamous bra case.2. Sennheiser, meanwhile, gives you an outdated (haven't seen these in years) airplane double connector, 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, USB C to A cable, and finally a nice cloth case (my color combo was gray).3. Additional note: wired headphones, being wired, both the Grado and Beyerdynamic gave 3.5mm to 6.3mm audio adapters. Being a high-end model, the T1 also came with a case.Final thoughts:1. I normally don't use wireless headphones, at most, a Bluetooth amp, the aforementioned USB DAC and one of my usual wired cans. But my brother convinced my to try a pair for an upcoming trip. They really are convenient.2. The unfortunate thing I found in my search, as of this writing (9/30/2022), there are no modern (i.e., BT 5) really high-end e.g., T1 level wireless headphones out there. They all seem to top out around the $400 mark, which sounds a lot, but not for a ultra high end wired headphone.3. Of the 10 or so better choices out there, what I would recommend depends on your music style, phone, use/need. Loyal Apple users - Airpods Max, Android users - this Sennheiser M4, hardcore must have the best music quality users - wait - niche uber manufacturers are getting there.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2022",AFZQEWUCJEY5NLQE6XQY3QQ5WC3Q,TRUE,36,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The Momentum 4 checks all the boxes.Battery life is insane. Once charging cord (finally) is great. ANC is solid; no uncomfortable pressure or buzzing; and I took a flight while barely realizing we were on one.The folding and durability is nice and can easily carry these in a backpack with many other items. Extremely comfortable even for an 8hr session (and I wear glasses).I am far from an audiophile, but I have zero complaints about sound quality for calls, music, games, and movies. The in-app EQ is a good option. Mic quality is solid and have received zero complaints even on external customer calls.I was not expecting to like the touch controls. I do wish they were physical buttons, customizable, and on both earcups instead of just the right hand one. However, the actual experience (swipe up/down for volume, left/right for tracks, and tap to pause) is solid, with very few accidently presses. On-head detection worked perfectly. The physical button on the headset being a mute button while on a call is amazing, and this is detected in software on mobile (example being discord) and on desktop (WebEx mutes and unmutes itself in software when I press the button on the headset). This is amazing.The Multipoint connection (android phone and windows laptop) is very solid; notifications on the phone don't steal audio from a work call or vice versa. I do wish the headphone jack was a normal 3.5mm one instead of a smaller plug on the headset, then I wouldn't have to keep track of the adapter cord. Minor issue; very glad there is still a physical cable option along with the USB-C charging.Overall, this was the headset I was looking for and expect to run it for years.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHXNPP7TG2E73FWLT7L7PDVSH4XA,TRUE,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I listen primarily to electronic music and the bass is just right. It's clear and full, but not overbearing once EQ'd down a couple dB in the app. What you give up for this is comfort and ANC quality. These are not the sort of headphones you forget that you're wearing. They definitely have some heft to them and a higher clamping force than others. They do feel solidly built though. The ANC works well but from other reviews I've read, it falls a bit short compared to Bose and Sony's offerings.

R3IPWB05P9IKRT,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best All Over Ear Headphones,Customer Ed,5,"I’ve tried many over ear and in ear headphones, including the Sony WH-1000xm4 and xm5, apple AirPods Max, and other Sennheisers. Simply put, these are the best. These have enhanced my enthusiasm for listening to new music, and I love listening to old favorites with all the luxurious, crisp detail these headphones can reproduce. I’ve broken it down into the most important features to me:Sound Quality: I’m not audiophile, but I can say these sound far superior to any of the other over ears I’ve used. Sennheiser is known for its neutral, accurate sound, and these seem to be the best iteration of that sound. Soundstage is wide open with incredible spatial effects, instrument separation, and no notable coloration or boxy sound. Despite the clarity, the bass here is incredible. You can feel it, but in a natural way that really underpins the song. Strong, natural base and incredibly detailed throughout the frequency spectrum, I can’t wait to get these things on my ears all day long. Just a pure joy of a listening experience.ANC - very strong. Not quite as strong as the Sony, but not enough of a drop down. You won’t notice much of a difference between these and any of the “better” ANC headphones. Same goes for the transparency mode, which allows you to hear ambient noise when you switch it on.Battery life - 60 hours is insane, but in my experience I’m getting that with ANC on so the claims don’t seem to be exaggerated.Comfort: definitely a little heavier than my Sonys, but buttery smooth headband and even weight distribution make for comfortable, long listening sessions. May be a bit of adjustment period if you’re used to lighter cans, but certainly not as heavy as the AirPods Max.Touch controls: definitely take some getting used to at first. Double tap right ear cup to enable ANC or transparency, pinch in or out to change noise cancellation level (this control is wonky and very hard to use, so I just use adaptive ANC and let it do its thing). Tracks can be switched by swiping left or right, but this can be an adventure. Depending on the angle that they’re sitting on your head, it can be hard to swipe in the exact right direction. With some practice it gets better. Same goes for up and down for volume, and volume changes seem to occur depending on the length of your swipe, rather than in steady increments. This means getting it to your exact desired volume using touch controls can be difficult. Answering and ending calls is also done through swiping forward and back, so you can experience the same issues. Overall, not the most intuitive controls, but not a deal breaker and with time it becomes easier.Call quality: I keep these on while working and take phone calls. Through some testing, these provide much better voice pickup and clarity than any of my in ears or even the built in speaker phone. If I’ve got an important call, I know the person on the other line will hear every word if I’m using these. Switching between calls, music, and podcasts with these all day long, these are perfect. They also have multipoint connectivity, providing seamless switching between laptop and phone.Overall, these are the best over ears I’ve found for what I use them for. Music, podcasts, commuting, movies and tv shows, work calls. The highest praise I have for these is they have revived my love of music as they remind you how good music can sound when reproduced with clarity and detail.If you’ve got some deep pockets, I’d also pick up the Momentum true wireless 3 earbuds, to have that same beautiful sound during those times that full over ear headphones aren’t appropriate.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2022",AGORAFANRG5DE6BQM4JS3ZO3EAQA,TRUE,47,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R1UEJPGVRZ9X65,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller cups than other Sennheiser - amazing anyway, read full review",George Fields,5,"You're a smart person, you can find the frequency response curves, ANC curves, etc. online. This review is about the overall experience. Note: I happen to LOVE the way these look, simple, plain, understated... smaller target for theft, too.I have the Sennheiser HD 515, HD 598, and HD 598 Cs, and the Sennheiser GAME ONE headset. Those (and most other from the brand) have large, extremely comfortable ear cups. I know that, and need that, because I used to play World of Warcraft for about 50 hours a week, with headphones all the time.First impression—the cups are smaller. It just so happens that I have normal ears, and the other Sennheisers I have are too big for me, with a good margin to adjust them when the skin gets tired around my earlobes. The MOMENTUM 4 surprised me by being smaller, but—they have a really good design and are concave, with more space inside the cup than it seems, especially in the back. I am able to find a few different positions where my earlobes are not pressed (or even touched) at all, but how they fit you will depend on your ears, which is something important to consider.The review at SoundGuys is on point. The M4 do have a bit more low end than my other sets, and I like that; it's easier to EQ your way down than up. Overall very happy with the sound, I don't think you'd be disappointed. As the SG review says, the ANC is a little weak sometimes; I don't care, to me that's secondary.Battery life is amazing, the 60hrs claim seems accurate. Build quality is plasticky and okay, I would baby them a bit. Touch controls are precise and responsive for me, even with the guide stickers still on the outside (which I've removed after my wife made fun of me for it). The app seems to work all right, I think it's better to set your preferences and then not use it anymore, as sometimes the settings get changed around a bit for no reason. (KEEP UP WITH FIRMWARE UPDATES, though.)Connectivity—outstanding. Bluetooth (multipoint x2), passive mode, and USB mode. Quickly: * Bluetooth: works fine. Good range, it seems. I don't care for or like the multipoint, and I think it's irrelevant. * USB mode: use USB-A to USB Type C cable (included). Headphone presents as a regular USB headset to the computer. Works great and charges at the same time. * Passive mode: Uses a 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable (included) to use as a plain Jane wired headset. You CAN power on the M4 in this mode and benefit from better sound, or leave them off (on purpose, or if the battery is dead). I DISAGREE THAT THE SOUND IS BAD IN PURE PASSIVE MODE, WITH POWER OFF. It's slightly subpar compared to BT/USB/powered passive, but it's JUST FINE, and pretty good to boot.The SG review docks the M4 on mic quality, but in my tests people's feedback was that the calls were clear and noise-free, even when I was doing yard work on a very windy day. Still, YMMV.Case—it's a carrying case. It's... functional, plain, the way I like my coffee.My only complaint, if this tells you anything—the charge port and 2.5mm port are on the RIGHT cup, whereas all other sets I've ever had or seen have the cable going to the LEFT one. The power button and touch controls are also on the RIGHT, so maybe that's why, but on the (infrequent) occasions when you may have a cable attached, it's not where you'd be used to finding it.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2023",AGORTA25R56MRPEW236JMI3XD25Q,TRUE,111,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R11QF4OKPIM01C,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wait For The Next Version,J.C.,3,"The ANC was incredible, the battery life was amazing, everyone could hear my voice on calls, they were comfortable, connected over Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm for audio (with one mini end, which was kind of silly), and they came with a nice case.The construction felt decent enough to me, although, it is definitely not the metal build many come to expect from Sennheiser.Audio quality was a little muddy in my opinion, using it mostly to listen to synthwave music and watching Dolby ATMOS content via PLEX. The app certainly didn't let me dial things in, which may have been why things didn't sound amazing. Overall, it was just okay.So, what's not great? The app on Android is awful, the headphones would sometimes cut out to a loud static, or pick up RF interference, and the touch controls are awful and easily activated by tilting your head. Also, there's no ""Lossless"" option for hi-res audio and you need a separate dongle to use on your PC (and still can't use it as a gaming headset without it stepping down to AM radio quality I/O).Once the new Bluetooth codec standards for lossless 16-bit / 44.1kHz come out, and once you can pair to networks and some of the new protocols coming out in the next few years, I would be curious to see if Sennheiser revises this and fixes the issues I've mentioned.It's very close, but it's just not worth the asking price. Maybe on a sale, or if you're okay with being limited by the codecs available.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AGX4NRDWLOEZF64P7JCMFL3CU5IQ,TRUE,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2DR9OKGN9HSJV,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wired Mode is sometimes totally bugged. Manufacturer defect.,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this pair about a month ago, and when i got it out of the box to explore the features, I noticed some serious issues; the bluetooth latency is terrible for gaming, and in wired mode (to reduce latency), sometimes the sound is ruined.I'm a gamer, and I like to play a lot of PUBG, so I need great sound, AND I need low sound latency, I noticed that in bluetooth mode, the latency is just too high. Like ~100 ms high. Maybe this can be improved to like 40 ms with the right bluetooth controller, but I really want ~5 ms.When I first got it, and I tried to use wired mode (and stumbled upon the 2.5mm jack, had to buy new cables. Wtf is wrong with you. >:C), the sound quality was trashed. I don't mean ""bad"" like some picky audiophile. I mean TRASHED. I can hardly describe how bad it is, it's like the volume is dropped by 30 db, and for some reason only a few narrow bands of frequency manage to make it through, making some noises come through orders of magnitude louder than others. It's just this unlistenable murky mess. No exaggerationThis problem persisted for like 3 days, and it all of a sudden went away for no reason. It worked just fine for a whole month, (and I adored the sound quality) and now the problem has come back for no reason. What the hell is this? I noticed that if I back out the jack on my DAC by ~1/16 inch, I get decent sound quality IN MONO. Unacceptable. Factory resetting the headphones did nothing. A firmware update did nothing. Restarting my computer? nothing. Shutting off all bluetooth? Nothing.The other features are fine. Maybe I felt like the bass was comparatively weak to my old bassy cans, but I got used to it.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AGGGNM37DWTLZE7UPYKWPFJCCBCQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
ROYKDE0H8KYE6,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite wireless headphones,mariah kemmerer,5,"You can use them while charging - all other arguments are obsolete.Lol but no seriously, not only do these have a crazy long battery life you can also use them while they are plugged in charging. I'm a simple woman with simple needs, but even the Sony M5 can't do that.I had been debating between these and the Sony 1000XM5 and had even purchased the M5. But I had to immediately return them. I'm not sure what it is with Sony and their terrible sizing. They were just too big and loose. Thankfully, Sennheiser has never disappointed and the fit of the Momentum 4 is great. As a general consumer (not a self-proclaimed audiophile) I found these very comparable in build and material to the Sony M5.Coming from always wearing open-back Sennheisers there is a drop in sound quality, but (!) that is expected and I don't find that a detractor. They still sound great. I think the Sony M5 had a bit more of a clearer sound, and the Momentum 4 has a bit too much bass out of the box - but with a little tweaking in the Sennheiser app, I found a happy spot. Noise-canceling is good - I wouldn't say top of its class, but I haven't found myself ever thinking ""gee, I wish they blocked out more noise."" And once I turn on music or a video I don't notice any background noise even in busy places.The mic is okay. I don't really use it, so it's not on my priority list - but if it is for you the Sony M5 outclasses these by a mile on mic quality.The Bluetooth connection works well for me and has a good range. But there can be some drawbacks if you're switching between more than 2 devices regularly. Between my iPad and iPhone, these headphones connect great, and audio will bounce back and forth between them pretty seamlessly. When only 2 devices are connected, they will always be connected and you don't have to do anything to switch between them. BUT once you add a third device you have to start regularly opening the app. You MUST have the app. Because I connected my iPad and phone first, after the headphones get turned on it will auto-connect to those 2 devices (regardless of what it was last connected to). When I first connected these headphones to my computer I couldn't understand why there was no audio and the sound settings were stuck on mute. Fun fact - you have to go into the app and open up the connection manager and toggle on the device you want to use. Only two devices can be toggled on at once. I have to do this every time I want to use these with my computer - because as I said it will revert to my iPad and phone automatically. Not a dealbreaker - but a pain in the ass.Touch controls. I don't hate them. I had a pair of older Bluetooth Sony's with touch controls and absolutely hated them. Bane of my existance. But I find these controls a lot better thought out and executed. I don't accidentally hit them and once I fiddled with the control options in the app (you can customize what some touches do) I really like being able to double-tap between ambient and noise canceling.Overall I really like these headphones and am very happy I returned the Sony M5 and grabbed these.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2022",AHMZTM2ZRR7O2HALQIPM7OE2UQUA,TRUE,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The headphones are comfortable to wear all day and I don't notice any problems with the clamping pressure or the weight of the headphones sitting on top of my head. The sound quality is great, if you take some time to fine tune the EQ settings. They are also aesthetically pleasing for what it's worth.Most of the problems seem to be software related. Bluetooth switching between phone and laptop is pretty ok but at least once per day my headphones will connect to my phone and I need to shut off the phone bluetooth to get audio from my laptop. Also, there is no ""regular"" mode for the ANC, meaning that you either get the amplified sound outside of the headphones, or can feel the ANC working. There needs to be a setting that turns both off and gives the regular amount of muffling over ear headphones would normally provide. I also despise the fact that I need to use the Sennheiser app on my phone to control EQ or amount of ANC, why not make a simple desktop app that can do the same?","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AFKOEAETUFFKKOLH7WK5CIUZCF4A,TRUE,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
RTN9WQR625T86,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars What you need to know...,Randall Whitted,5,"Before buying these, you gotta know some things. First, if you listen to earbuds a lot, over-ear headphones sound different. The sound is less directly in your ear, and more around you. As such, there is less impact. That doesn't mean these aren't good, they're just not shoved into your ear.Second, the source makes or breaks these. A crappy source will sound crappy on these and you'll end up blaming the headphones. It's actually a feature of the headphones though. They reproduce what you put into them very well. Go into Spotify and mess with the EQ there if you feel the need. I like sharp treble and got it that way. Change the stream setting to highest quality. Plug them into a good digital to analog converter (DAC). Try different sources and you'll see whatever you may not be liking is not the headphones. As an acoustic guitarist, I was hoping for the same sound I get with my Martin on my lap. I'd love to have headphones that sound like Tony Rice and Dave Grisman are standing on either side of me, but that's not gonna happen. Again, the source matters. These headphones are not a hand-built American acoustic guitar played by a master standing next to you, but they'll sound more like it than the majority of headphones.Third, we've become programmed to in-your-face sound. These Momentum 4 are very much ""grown-up"" headphones. They articulate. They detail. The present. But they don't floor you with over-the-top sound all through the range. There are plenty of good, inexpensive headphones and earbuds that will pop your eardrums. I personally recommend Anker for that. My Space A40 earbuds are awesome, but when I A/B tested the A40 and these Momentum 4, I realized there were instruments I didn't even realize were there when listening with the A40 earbuds.Fourth, the bluetooth is dumb at first. From what I can tell, they won't work like you'd expect until you launch the app as part of the connection process. It's fine though. Just don't give up on them right off the bat because of that.Other random thoughts - they're super UNcomfortable right away, become very comfortable rather quickly - like within minutes. Also, good headphones do have a break-in period, and these are no exception. Be sure to try the wired connection on some different sources as well. MacBooks have good DACs in them. Anker makes a good USB-C to aux adapter with a DAC in it. The bluetooth connection can sound pretty dang good though. And the microphones in this headset are almost creepy-good. Also, bluetooth range is perfectly fine. I went three rooms away in my house with no issues at all.Summary - I was thinking of returning these, but I know Sennheiser so I messed with settings and connections and I'm glad I did. They're great headphones, but the key is to remember - if your source is crap, they will faithfully reproduce that crap.","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023",AEJWET4WAUKOAUJKFYEZSZKWTTNA,TRUE,104,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2GC7X8P84LSAI,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost excellent,Lloyd,4,"After much research I decided on these. I chose them for the positive reviews and the good price pint. I really like the look as well. I purchased them in white. After receiving them I quickly downloaded the app and got stated. As many have said, the app isn’t always great. Sometimes, it doesn’t connect properly and it really annoying. I am not an audiophile or a tech person but these sound great. I use the podcast setting constantly. Music sounds pretty amazing. I also love the intuitive touch controls. I looked at the manual online and watched a ton of videos to make sure I was optimizing the features. They are pretty comfortable. The ear cups actually don’t bother me when I have earrings in or glasses on which is great. The headpiece is very soft and luxurious feeling. The automatic pause and restart is awesome when it works. Then only issue with this is that if I take them off and lay them down and do not turn them off, when you go to play something Bluetooth’d to another device, it’s will often just play on you headphones that are laying down somewhere no not on your head. The ANC is just ok. I bought these because I stupidly knocked my Bose off of my head while cleaning the pool. They still work after much drying but they don’t last long on the charge. These are nowhere near the ANC of the Bose or even AirPod Pros. I have not used the SONYs so I cannot compare those. However, I am fine with them being just ok in this feature as I use them outside to walk and run and kind of would like to be able to hear what’s going on around me without having full traffic noise. Here are my issues…..first off, every phone call that comes in, when I answer it with headphones on….it immediately disconnects the call. It works fine if I call out. I have noticed this is a problem as evidenced on messages boards but there doesn’t really seem to be much of a solution. I contacted the company to see if they. Had a solution. Their response? Just return them to Amazon, as they have a better return policy in the Sennheiser Amazon store. The return policy is 30 days. Mind you….I purchased them March 24, and my original email was sent March 29. Today is April 24. Thus, leaving me no time to return them (I DID tell them in my email when I purchased them). I asked two questions and they didn’t address the one above at all. Really unhappy with the customer service for a $300 product. So, if you’re a tech and figure out whatever issue you have; great. their wise maybe look somewhere that has better customer service. But, they DO sound great and are comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2023",AGHSFBOT6TPDTGZFUMTIZP577SOQ,TRUE,24,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3CYLDF6PLZCPT,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointment,art,3,"Bought this headset as a replacement for my old PXC550. I had a few Sennheiser headsets over the years, and this one is major disappointment. I bought it because PXC550 was aging and I always wanted to buy momentum, because it was considered higher product line.1. Design - it is step back from original Momentum. If I wanted Sony I could buy Sony. I bought this headset because I like the brand, but design...why not copy iPods? Dumb.2. Comfort- clamping action is much stronger then PXC550 or Sony XM5(tried in store). Pads relatively hard and ears sometimes do not fit well.3. Controls - BAD, really BAD, DID I mention that they are BAD? I am comparing them to old model of PXC550.On/OFF functionality - why not to keep same function when cups are flat headset is off when turned in listening position headset is ON. With this headset you never know if the are on or off. Reviewers say ""it is not a problem because headset has large battery life"" - this is most dumb excuse you can come up with.Tap to Play/Pause - some times it works some times it does does not. You never know what will happen, will play, will it stop, will it turn off ANC?Volume Up/Down- no audible feed back when you raising or lowering the volume using headset and no immediate reaction. Why not to keep same functionality as on older headsets each volume change would respond with the sound.ANC- What ANC? most reviewers say it is slightly worse then Sony ... they are lying it is pretty much worse then anything I had, including $30 Chinese junk. This gesture adjustment does not really work, double tap sometimes work some times does not. On maximum ANC I still hear voices and passing cars. However it does cancel the wind which is good.4. Sound - Ok sound is not really bad. It is well balanced and has just a few more details then other headsets I tried Not within same price range, but within same consumer class I could hear background singer on one of the songs. It is louder then PXC550 which is good, but balance and detail is pretty much the same. This headset has no Stage at all. Sound lucking ""WOW"" feeling, it is pretty flat.I noticed this headsets has random disconnects. not really bad, but still worth to mention.I am still thinking about returning it, or keep it for few more days to see if they grow on me.I would say price (250) is pretty good for what you get.if you never had anything better it would be good headset for the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AGFPE3TGGCHH7S4DE5Z7HZ7ZCAUA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3BCMJ8RYR5L76,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Was I just maybe expecting too much?,Giratina,3,"Based on other reviews I decided to pick these up and the btd600 dongle meant to go with it for pc etc, Honestly im pretty disappointed. First the anc may as well not exist as it blocks nothing even when set to max or adaptive, can still hear everything as if its right next to me. Second the sound quality sounds... not sure how to describe it but maybe muddy or sounding like you're listening through a barrier. The headphones also struggle to handle intense songs like edm without distorting any voices while there is any bass and almost vibrates the voice causing it to sound off (ive tested tons of eq settings). Using them wired doesn't seem to fix the quality issue either. The bass itself is fine though once adjusted depending on the song speed. The touch controls turn back on every time you turn these off even when set to off on every device you have it connected to. Comfort wise they do start to bend and hurt your ears after a while requiring constant adjusting. Overall I'm pretty disappointed for something in the $300+ range as they sound like other $100 headphones. There's a chance maybe mine is broken but the hassle of swapping them isn't worth it.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AG5Y4LSKJTORYYBYUOJ3IBGIC2LQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1OLFI88OUFMZ9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Best in class!,Shelby Yale Marr,5,"I went to BestBuy to get my hands on a few of the top contenders. Sony XM5, Bose 700, and a few others not worth mentioning. They did not have a Sennheiser momentum 4 in the store for demo, they had to be ordered. The battery life of the Sony and the Bose were better than the others they had available in store. The sound quality was good. The materials felt cheap some more than others. I did not care for the skinny headband on some of them. After trying them out, I went on Amazon’s website and ordered the Sennheiser momentum 4. The 60 hour battery life, and fast charging is amazing. The noise canceling is excellent, I work with a lot of heavy equipment, it is loud all the time. I have used them on several long flights for both music from my phone or my tablet, or the airplanes movie selection. Several of the flights had very loud and obnoxious children, the noise canceling and good volume level made it much more pleasant. The build quality of the Sennheiser momentum 4 feels much more premium than the Sony or the Bose. The sound quality and clarity is unmatched to anything that I have tried, as far as wireless headphones. The frequency response is incredible with the 42 mm drivers. The gesture controls are intuitive, and very easy to use and get used to. I can wear them for hours my head does not get tired or sore. Everyone that I have come across that has tried them wants to set for themselves. Using them at work I often have multiple phone calls, there are gestures you can use on the side control to swap between calls. The microphones built into the headset pick up your voice clearly and eliminate background noise and wind for very clear calls. They are great for short sessions, but also long sessions as I have worn them for over 12 hours in a row. I wear glasses and they do not bother me while wearing glasses. I have had them for nearly a year. The battery life is still very strong. You can go on vacation and not have to charge the headphones until you return. I had a pair of Brookstone noise, canceling headphones years ago. When they eventually failed, I picked up a pair of Sony noise, canceling headphones. The Sony’s eventually failed as well. I replaced them with Bose they were wired the wire deteriorated very rapidly. Replaced them with a set of Bose earbuds, they are handy, but for a long flight the Sennheiser’s are definitely the way to go. Amazing sound quality. Transparency mode is also a very handy feature. Double tap the side of the headphone to activate or deactivate transparency mode so you can hear what is going on around you. The ability to lift the ear cup to pause playback is very handy. They also power down when you place them in the very nice case.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AGXNT7BE4PKZY7LPRQ5IMFXHPLTQ,TRUE,19,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2UYH59HBOTDSC,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent pair of headphones,Tyler,4,"I already had plans to buy these but after my Sennheiser CX wireless earbuds took a tumble in the washer, I kinda had to get these. I was already aware of the numerous issues that people had with these headphones but after having these for 2 weeks, I never ran into any of them.First Impression- Overall really like the look of these with the fabric headband and an all-around clean look. A little plasticky feeling but it isn't the kind of cheap plastic you would find on inexpensive headphones.Sound Quality- Now I'm not a big headphone person or audiophile guy but to me, these sound great and are probably one of the best-sounding over-ear wireless headphones I've ever owned. Super clear sound and very good bass.Call Quality- Mic is what you’d expect. Not the best but it's good enough for calls. I was able to hear clearly from people on the other end and they heard me on the other end perfectly fine. Side-Tone works great too however I don't like hearing myself so I keep it off.ANC-It really isn't that bad, although it doesn't match the quality that Sony headphones have, it's enough to water out most sounds around you however lower frequencies tend to pass through.App and Controls-The app is super easy to navigate through with a lot of settings to choose from. One of these settings would be an equalizer so you can mess around and find your own preferred sound configuration. Touch controls definitely took some time to get used to but they are very reactive to touch and I don't think you’ll need to do any double tapping. You can also disable touch controls if you don't like them. To address pairing issues, I had absolutely none. Might be different for you since I do still see these complaints every now and then.Comfort-Comfort is something that comes down to preference and to me, these were very comfortable on my head. I have a very large head so I had to adjust these to the max and they fit super well. Ear cups are nice and soft and the padding on the headband is firm on the sides and super squishy on the top. Overall super comfy on my head and I’ve yet to run into any issues with discomfort.Battery Life-Battery life is also pretty great too. 60 hours of battery life is more than plenty and can last you a whole week depending on how often you use them.Overall I think these are great all-around headphones that are great for daily use and travel. Of course, these do have some issues but they don't bother me enough to not recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AEQT6ADH6CI7LIAZKS2DH2DKTMFA,TRUE,36,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2QVBA1G7PUXO9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Love 'em,David,5,"Comfortable. Intuitive touch controls. Battery life. Design.Prior to purchase I did lots of research (thank you early adopters that do video reviews and websites that do qualitative reviews). I purchased these over other similarly priced brands based on the available features, price and design style. I have no remorse for the price I have paid.A little more depth:First, sound was a big priority for me -- I wanted a pair of headphones that reproduced sound/music as closely as an original artist may have desired. I found a website, soundguys.com, that provided a frequency-response (an audio-sweep starting from the 10's of Hz to the 10's of kHz is played through the headphones then the output noise difference is measured) graph for the headphones showing a very good sound reproduction (compared to a similarly priced set of Sony headphones these were more true to the input audio sweep).Second was design. I am a big fan of having the cups of the headphones attached to the headband via the swiveling 'pitch fork' design. Mounted/affixed to the middle of the/a headphone-cups. From an engineering/physics perspective, this means the pushing/pressing force exerted by the headband through the cups is centered from the middle of the cups, as opposed to the tops of the cup's--which invariably results in the pushing pressure being more towards the top of the cups (assumptions based on the XM5's design).Third. Comfort. The somewhat flat headband with its padding is forgettable and the pressure it supplies to the cups to the sides of one's (average size) head is sufficient -- maybe a little on the lite side. Also, the inside (head side) of the headband is a rubbery-like material, so no fears of hair/scalp oils dirtying a fabric there.Lastly, a subjective review of the sound, ANC, and call quality. I think the sound is amazing! The ANC is super cool. I've worn these on public transit (daily on the bus, and weekly on the train) and finally feel like I won't have any hearing damage from having to listen to the drone of the engine or cabin noise. You will still have some awareness of sounds around you, especially those of higher pitch/tone, but if you have music going (half volume for me) you will not hear any thing. Pass-through mode is also quite nice, though sometimes other's voices may sound quite (again, due to using half volume).Call quality is great. I held a phone call wherein I had a fan blowing on my head (wind noise). Neither I or my caller could hear any of the noise from the fan.Since owning the headphones, Sennheiser has released a firmware update for the ANC. Before and after the update I cannot empirically say I've notice any difference. Knowing Sennheiser will push updates to further improve the product is also reassuring (though for this price point, I believe most companies are doing this).Several sites/videos say that a similarly priced set of Sony's has better ANC than these, but I'll argue that you don't need a pair of Sony's to enjoy/receive a similar experience!Very subjective final thought: These (in white) look better than the competition.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AFESKG7TMN4LQ6DRVCIB355WIX5Q,TRUE,15,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RJOEYU7BI5AO4,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars While these sound fantastic, unfortunately the bad overpowers the good",ThereAreOrangesEverywhere,3,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser headphones for years and I have several other wired headphones from them that I've used for years as well. After reading up on the current wireless headphone offerings from various companies I decided to buy these since I already trusted the brand and the reviews were shining.I'm an audiophile hobbyist with a large head that makes most headphones become uncomfortable after a short amount of time being worn. I also have small ears and most in-ear headphones either don't fit at all or slip out within the first 10 minutes. I have some Airpod Pros that I sometimes use, but these also slip out from my ears constantly. The Sennheiser Momentum 4's fit better than a lot of headphones I've had, however after about 30 minutes of use, they become uncomfortable for me. If they just extended out a little further I don't think that would be an issue, but they don't. I wish more headphone companies made their headphones with greater expandable options, but oh well. If you're reading this and also had the large-head problem, I have a pair of AKG K 702as that I've used for a decade and they're very comfortable.The comfort is not the main issue though. It's the software to manage the headphones, and also the software/firmware on the headphones themselves. It has trouble connecting to the headphones consistently. The headphones also would frequently (and randomly) disconnect while listening to music on my iPhone. It was incredibly frustrating, and after reading through some forums I found that it was due to more than one device being in the headphones ""Devices"" list (my wife tried these on her phone at one point). Even though the other device was not actively trying to connect and even had Bluetooth completely off, the issue was happening a lot. Once I removed the 2nd device through the app, the connectivity issues went away.That is not my main complaint with the headphones though. The ANC cannot be turned off. You can adjust it to your hearts content from full blast ANC to full transparency, but ANC is on at all times. That's not necessarily a deal breaker, but for some reason the ANC on these cans gave me instant headaches. I tried researching why this could be happening and how to reduce this, and since these headphones have some adaptive ANC capabilities I tried listening outside, in an empty room, in a car, downtown, etc. - and it always gave me a headache.If the app let you disable ANC entirely I would have gladly kept them. The sound is fantastic, especially for the price. The bass is very rich, the mids are clean and the highs are crisp without being shrill. The soundstage is extremely impressive given these are closed back. I would have thought these cost at least twice what they do on the sound alone. The battery is also super impressive, these lasted almost two weeks of daily use before I had to charge them.Sennheiser is a sound company, not a software company. If they are going to force managing features of their headphone into an app, they really need to build out the app better and have options as simple as turning on/off ANC. While I'm all for new technology and software (I work as a software engineer), I'm more old-school with devices like this specifically for this reason. If these cans had a few actual buttons or switches to toggle ANC and some other basic features instead of relying on an app and swipe gestures, I'd keep them forever.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2023",AEVMPVH3K5FBJXFMQMM6YAPNDNUA,TRUE,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RONNQB3KB0IWS,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones and extraordinary battery but iOS app did not work.,PMJ,4,"I received these headphones and put them on my head and they immediately paired with my iPhone (14 Pro Max). Touch controls are a little tricky but they do work. Sound is warm, balanced and very pleasant. I have a large head and the headphones feel comfortable covering my ears correctly. They seem to be light and well balanced. Sound is well balanced without being bass heavy or 'lumpy' with excellent detail on all the types of music to which I listen (mainly jazz, classical, electronic jazz and fusion with classic pop thrown in). I have yet to compare with the direct wired connect or via USB. Probably the best noise reduction headphones I have heard and are much smoother than the Sony XM4 and XM5 and less processed than the Bose QC 45s.The iOS app did not work. I installed it after the headphones had paired with my iPhone (as instructed by the instructions), started the app which showed that they had connected but when I tapped the headphone icon, it said it had not connected and I had to power off and remove the headphones from the bluetooth list on my phone. I performed the necessary changes and tried again with no success. I tried this 5 or 6 times with the same results. I gave up and tried a number of other strategies. I reset the headphones, deleted and reinstalled the app all to no avail.The headphones sound great but the inconvenience of trying to configure them manually is less helpful so I decided to send them back.Update 1: I also have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) and tried the installation of the app on that phone. BT pairing was more problematic but once paired the app worked correctly. I reset the headphones using the app (deleting the BT pairing list) and updated the headphones firmware. After doing this I tried again on the iPhone and it worked correctly this time. I am not sure whether it was the complete reset to factory settings or the updated firmware but it now appears to work on both iOS and Android.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AGTBK447OV5VAYFLVLFCMC3NOCDA,TRUE,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RW0GW7VS1ML79,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Punching WAY above their price point but have several unfortunate annoying features,Jordan Sage,4,"I have recently trued out a number of headphones across a variety of price points (e.g., the HifiMan Arya Stealth, B&W PX7, B&O H95). These beat out all the headphones that cost more than double. They were the most engaging of the wireless 'phones to listen to and the ones I wanted to keep coming back to. The are fun and energetic sounding, and are pretty generous in sound quality across the timbres. There is nothing these do that stands out sound-wise as super great - but no great sins anywhere either, and I did not find another bluetooth headphone that had such a good, balanced whole-picture sound like these do.I did, however, almost return these.The bluetooth interrupted several important business calls with no prompting from me whatsoever (and again, I had a half dozen Bluetooth headphones by my phone and none of them automatically interrupted more than 10-15 minutes into a call - totally unprompted - like these did).The other issue is that Sennhieser tried, I suppose, to get fancy with the touch controls on the side of the Right can. The issue with this is, if you touch or rest them against anything, the buttons will go off haphazardly. No other headphone I tested had any such issue. If you even lift these to scratch your ear, they will shut off or do something unintended. The good thing though is when you are ready to listen, you put them on your head and they will synch near instantaneously and be ready to play music. That's cool. But I am learning to live with all the unwanted features and touch activation of these.Altogether, I don't believe anything will touch these at the price point, and you would be hard-pressed to find many options under $1,000 that don't require an amplifier that will either. The feature set is annoying and intrusive. The design is bland and cheap looking. But they are comfortable to wear and they sound great.

R1ZBIQTOJ15PHY,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars But are they, are they really?",Lost_And_Confused,3,"I am really hesitant to write a review in light of how many people have left reviews that sound like they would give their first born for these things. I am not in that camp. I have several sets of over-the-ear and in-ear headsets including the Apple Airpod Max and the new Sony MX5. Having used equipment from Senn for 30 years, I am familiar with their products and how their philosophy, so many others, has changed over that time with a leaning towards mass market. Oh, I get it...make money or close the doors. All that said, here is my real world experience. Upon opening them, I like the case, the wired adapter, etc. The headset is lightweight and very comfortable, even when wearing with glasses. That said, they are the ""cheapest looking/feeling"" headset from Senn I have ever seen...they really feel like cheap plastic crap...but that is not why you buy a headset. Just setting expectations here. The battery life claim of 60 hours is absolutely comical - I have been getting more around 12 hours (calls/music/online meetings - almost all with ANC). The ANC itself is not at the level of Apple or Sony. It works, and I have been on a couple flights with them. There does not seem to be any background noise filtering on the microphone side though - certainly not on par with Apple or Sony, though the ANC works well enough for the wearer. Max volume is lower than other brands, if that is important to you, but certainly loud enough. Bass response is significantly BETTER than Apple or Sony, though the sound quality as a whole is muddier with less staging than others. The pairing has been fairly smooth - no where as seamless as say the Airpod Max's if you are in an Apple ecosystem, but on par with most other brands. The app is a bit pointless, but given that the single button and touch controls arent the greatest, it is helpful. For example, the pinching/reverse-pinching to engage ANC sort of works...? I did have my first pair of these die after about 10 hours of use - would no longer pair and the lights just did a non stop light show - but got them replaced through Amazon without issue, as I had them only 2 days. Conclusions? Given that the Apple product is always on sale for $100 off, the price point between all three products (The Sony MX5's, the Airpod Max's and these) are within $100 of each other, I would have a hard time recommending these to friends or family. I really cannot find a single compelling reason to select these over competing products. I mean, they are bad by any means, just bland. They don't stand out from a looks, sound, ANC, build quality, functionality, or any other way...they work, well enough, and in the class they are in they are fairly priced. I honestly feel you could do better with the Apple Airpod Max if you are a big Apple user or the Sony MX5's otherwise - and be happier with either of those versus these. In fact, if plastic, lower quality builds, but with good sound, good bass response and decent ANC is your thing, you could do better with the over the ear model from Status Audio and save a couple hundred bucks. Of course, all of the above is my personal opinion, not paid, no free samples, no fancy audio test equipment...YMMV.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2022",AFYGCCFUGZL6PNRESNIUYWDTPMJQ,TRUE,30,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R3T563LHCTJ4N1,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Love the headphones except for the garbled noise at times!!!!,azsteve01,4,"Sennheiser headphones have been my main headphones for watching TV since 2016 when i purchased the RS-175 wireless headphones. Roku has created a Private Listening mode and you cannot switch from headphone to tv/soundbar speakers easily since Roku disabled the TOSLink/headphone jack when you are using the Dolby sound hardware. A solution was needed and since you can connect to the soundbar via bluetooth the decision was made to find a bluetooth headphone that met my standards. Because of my loyalty to Sennheiser headphones the Momentum 4 were chosen.As stated Roku has created a Private Listening feature that makes it hard to use wire/fibre connection and bluetooth is the best solution to resolve the issues making it easier to switch between speakers and headphones.Major Issue:The only main issue with the Momentum 4 headphones is when you first connect, the sound is garbled for 5 to 10 seconds. You can either wait for the sound to clear up (annoying) or restart the video which can be a pain. Youtube and Plex are my main video apps i use and with youtube having to restart the videos each time gets old fast. The garbled sound is the same no matter what firmware is used.Minor issues:When you have the Momentum 4 connected to the app (iPhone) every time you are disconnected from the TV/Soundbar you have to use the app to reconnect. This is not convenient if the phone is not near. Unfortunately Roku has decided to disconnect any bluetooth connected after 5 minutes of idle time to save battery power on the headphones. This is not a Momentum 4 issue but reconnecting with the app make this cumbersome. Because of this problem the app is not being used at all and the headphones are set to factory default.The fit is not as good as the RS-175, ear cups need to be bigger.Pros:Excellent Sound, Long Battery Life, Noise Cancelling (even cancels out conversations), Touch Features, Light WeightI would recommend these to others but only if Sennheiser fixes the garbled issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2023",AHVWXOJUZYGFL7XQW5OY73KHERGQ,TRUE,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R30434Q2LI61Q,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars great sound, cancellation and battery but . . .",mike,5,"I decided on these because of the reviews. And price was right for me.Here is my honest opinion. Sound is awesome, and noise cancelling is good. The special features (like headphone turn off and on as you take them off and on. Side ear swipe controls and sennheiser app for more controls) Well . . . if they work . . . it is very nice. You can only run the app through your phone. So that is a drawback. I found the swipe controls don't hardly work unless you are using the app itself. So if I have music say on amazon music unlimited through my laptop none of the feature work well, or at all. If I am running my music through my phone and with the app the features work at first but the the longer I listen the less likely they are bound to work. Meaning the swipe controls for vol, skip song and tap on and off and turning on noise cancellations setting. I lose connection more then I should for no reason.Lets just say I have to go back to my phone app to turn on and off the feature to get them to work correctly way too much. So If you are OK with great sound and noise cancellation with a super long battery life and can put up with the flaws of the special features that you paid for, then buy these. They are very comfortable for me. Sound was too good to send them back though, just disappointed in the special features that sometimes work and sometimes not. (haven't used phone feature at all yet)update 06-16-24: So I now have had these about a year now. My opinion has changed and I thought I would update my review. I am old (62) so I still do a lot of listening through my MP3 players (I have several - not always listening through my phone). My biggest gripe when I got them was the controls and getting the touch features to work properly. Well, it may have been operator error and just getting used to the headphones. I don't seem to be having any trouble with any listening device anymore. When I take my headphones off my head they stop and when I put them back on they start. One thing that I had trouble with early on. I have had a chance to try out the phone features and sound since the purchase and it is pretty darn good. I can not compare to other competitors though, And I don't use that a lot.So sound is great, comfort is great, battery is great and features are now upgraded to great as wellI love em.

R1QTST5YMU94UV,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, but uncomfortable, with serious firmware issues",Brandon Watkins,4,"I'm borderline obsessed with Sennheiser, and gave these headphones an honest try; I really wanted to like them, but until they fix the firmware, I couldn't recommend these to anyone. Tested on multiple devices, all of which are up to date.To future-proof my review (because I won't remember to edit my review once the firmware problems have been addressed), I rated these 4 stars based on the assumption that there will be a future fix to the firmware problems. If taking the firmware into account, I think I'd rate these 2 stars (as of 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphones have quality sound, probably on par with the price point. Not significantly better than my PXC 550-II's, but they do have a bit more depth and bass.Their noise cancellation is good, but not as good as my Bose QC35’s, which is to be expected.The battery life is incredible. I don't think I'm getting 60 hours (volume kept at around 20-40%), but they're still awesome.Cons:These are nowhere near as comfortable as my Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. They put more pressure on my ears/temples, and the headband is way firmer. My head is aching after about 30 minutes of use.There are significant firmware issues (my firmware is up to date, as of 8/31/22):When using the auto power off mode, they turn on (and sync to your phone) any time they’re moved. This will of course silence your phone’s alerts, as they’re playing over the headphones that you didn’t mean to turn on.When using the on-head detection, they keep turning on and off while they're sitting around my neck.Whenever I answer my phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) and change the output to these headphones it just hangs up the phone. Haven't tried answering using the headphone's touch controls, it's possible that would work.While the transparency mode is a nice feature, it's almost laughable compared to my AirPod Pro's and Sony WF-1000XM4's. It sounds just barely better than wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These can connect to 2 devices at a time, but when switching between paired (and connected) devices (for example: listening to audio on my tablet, when I get a text alert on my phone, which interrupts tablet audio for a second, before switching back to tablet again), and whenever I answer my phone, as mentioned above, audio quits playing over my headphones. My phone says it's still connected, but it doesn't show up as an output in any apps. I have to reconnect it to my phone to get it working again.Whenever I pair them with a new device, it disconnects from existing connected devices. I have to reconnect afterward.As much as I want to like these headphones, until Sennheiser fixes these software issues, it's just not worth the hassle.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AENHFSUN5AOQRWBL5HVKOFBRSN4A,TRUE,56,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R9UOJPHMC1N5R,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones with a few nitpicks,Stan Jarensky,5,"I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2022",AFWSMMKN2GVUKOJA4BDMDRSG7JZQ,TRUE,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

RJB49JIZ1OE9H,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but not great due to finicky features.",Ryan M Robinson,4,"The sound, noise cancellation, durability, and battery life were the reasons I bought these headphones, and they've delivered in those areas. Sadly, I'm knocking a star off the overall rating because of their ""quality"" of life features and short range.The headphones are meant to sense when they're on your head or not. Sadly, these think they're on my head when they're not, and not on my head when they are, with annoying frequency.Occasionally the ""buttons"" stop working. I use quotes because the actual button works fine, but the tap controls seem to stop working randomly. They'll do the little noise in my ear that indicates the headphones have registered me tapping, but have no actual effect.Further, I live in a house of about 950 sq. ft., yet if I leave the 8x8 room that is my office there's a good chance the sound will start cutting in and out due to the poor range of these headphones. I had a pair of $60 headphones before these, and the range was twice as good on those. This results in sound skipping in and out if I'm more than 6 feet away from my computer, or about 8 feet with no walls in between. It would be nice to be able to fold laundry in the next room over while listening to these, but I cannot.Overall, great sound quality, durability, noise cancelling (very important as I'm work from home with a toddler and an infant in the house), and battery life (I use them 8-10hrs per day and charge once per week), but poor quality of life.

R3QDH5SFCC0EE9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 vs Sony WH-1000XM5,Matthew,5,"I've been a Sennheiser fan for a while now and wanted to give these a shot vs the fan favored Sony WH-1000XM5s. Used the Momentum 4s for around a week and was incredibly impressed with the battery life, ease of use, and the sound quality. If you have some audiophile grade equipment with a separate DAC/Amp combo this does not sound as good. That being said, this is miles above alternatives in it's price range.After adjusting to the sound of the Sennheisers for a few days, I immediately had a negative reaction when trying out the Sonys. To my ears they had a noticably dryer sound profile where the highs and mids sounded muffled and flat in comparison (Note: not accuracy flat, just plain dull sounding). The bass is pretty equivalent, at least in EDM/metal/hip hop genres. I listened for a few hours in the Sonys and just couldn't find any songs I thought sounded measurably better than the Sennheisers. Even listening to the same song on the tablet and phone with both headphones back to back, everything was brighter, clearer, and warmer in the Sennheisers and have a noticably better build quality. My first initial reaction to Sennheiser build quality was negative because they felt much lighter than I was expecting having used more serious headphones. The Sonys felt even lighter and more plastic-y/cheaper in comparison.The noise cancelling was noticably better in the Sonys than the Sennheisers, which may or may not be a deal breaker for some. I would imagine the Sonys would perform better on an airplane, but for home/office use I was perfectly happy with both.TLDR: The Sennheisers are the no brainer choice for me.**Momentum 4 quirks/nit picking:- My head gets hot in any headphones with leather ear cups, I could not find alternative/cooler padding which is worth the sound/seal trade off.- The sensors to know if it's on your head are pretty sensitive. It's good when you lift off an ear to hear someone else in the room, they pause. It's bad when you take them off, they 'sleep' on the desk, anything brushes/touches the headphones. It will automatically switch your audio source from your phone back to the headphones. Depending on how often you listen to audio on your phones speaker or are around where these will be when you are not using them, it's easier to turn them off when not in use to avoid having to change your media output on your phone back to the speaker. Samsung phones have a quick media output switch in the drop down quick menu, but not all phones make it this easy.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AGJ3EARFU6PJA75WKR76Z7WUOLNA,TRUE,27,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3S9UDPCJTRMN0,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars M4’s vs XM5’s, if you’re after sound quality this is it.",Seth Montgomery,5,"Sound Quality:So first of all, I have been a big fan of Sony’s wireless lineup and decided to take a departure with these. After these arrived, I did a direct comparison on these vs Sony’s XM5’s, with EQ to my liking and without (across several genres.) The M4’s even without any EQ adjustments beat my XM5’s with them. Man, these things sound great. Clear, precise, open sound. The treble is truly so much more detailed than on the XM5’s, and the midrange and bass feel balanced in more naturally. When I switched back to XM5’s to compare, I was actually shocked at just how much I felt like I was missing in comparison.Comfort:The XM5’s spoil you a bit with their insane plush earcups and super light weight, but I was expecting a bigger difference between those and the M4’s. For me, these are perfectly comfortable. XM5’s definitely win here, but the SQ on the M4’s more than makes up for that.Noise Cancelling:I’m not the person to give the best feedback on this, it’s the last thing I care about. However, If noise cancelling happens to be your main consideration, it’s XM5 here.Setup/connectivity:I was prepared for problems and inconveniences based on reviews and got none. Smooth experience for me so far.In summary, GREAT sound, and if that’s your biggest consideration, I don’t know if you’ll find better elsewhere in Bluetooth headphones anywhere close to this price point.

I know it's slightly unfair to compare the Momentum 4 to this particularly Sony headphone but I didn't expect the Sony's to compare in terms of sound quality (they don't come close) or noise cancelling (the Sony's were pretty similar honestly... very good on both). But I did expect quality design and construction since it's virtually identical to higher priced Sony's. Bottom line: Sennheiser has quality construction and Sony doesn't. As soon as you pick up a pair of the Sony's, it's easy to tell that they are somewhat fragile. I even had a pretty good notion of where they would break... and I was right. The Sennheiser's are much more robust, and really feel like they can handle some tough use.I also found the app to be very intuitive and easy to use, unlike a few other reviewers... definitely easier than the Sony app.My only slight complaint is the touch sensitive control feature.

R2LOLFHZ6R8BHD,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great and usage is very streamlined,Henry,5,"I like how most Sennheiser headphones sound, and these are no exception. The app also lets you further tune the sound to your liking if you feel the need to, and if you don't want to play around with the EQ options, you can just use the ""sound personalization"" feature which is basically a quiz that will help create an optimal sound setting for you. The usage experience with these is the most streamlined I have had with any headphones so far. I use my headphones primarily with my PC, and with older headphones switching the connection from my PC to my phone was a pain, and because of that I rarely did it. With these, you have multi-point connection, which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once, and the headphones will switch between them based on which one is playing audio. That, combined with the auto on and off feature, means I can just pick these up off my desk and put them on, then use my PC and/or phone as needed without thinking about it, and then just plop them back on my desk when I'm done and they will shut down automatically. There are however a couple of things I can think of to complain about. Number one is I wish Sennheiser made a dedicated Windows app to change settings directly from a PC, but the multi-point connection means this isn't really a big deal anymore because they are always connected to my phone anyway if I want to change settings. Number 2, I would like to have some kind of audio queue when I reach the midpoint between transparency mode and ANC. As is, when you are using the touch controls to scroll between full ANC and full transparency mode, you get an audio queue when you reach either of those settings, but the midpoint where you have neither ANC nor transparency mode active isn't obvious unless you pull out the app and check where it is set. A small issue but it would further improve ease of use with these. Overall, I'm super happy with them.

They absolutely have better noise canceling, but when listening to music or a movie it is much less noticeable.

R2L5D070KJ5IMJ,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars The firmware is not up to par,Lumiere,3,"Pros- Comfortable to wear- Long battery life- Neutral sound- Transparency mode- Works wiredCons- Software is horrible- Firmware is horrible- Transparency mode amplifies wind noises more than voiceMost of my headphones are open back, so I wanted a pair of closed headphones for the office. Since I usually use Sennheiser headphones, that and the transparency mode swayed me to get this over Bose QC45 and Sony 1000XM4.I'm not sure I made the right choice. Almost none of the features work properly.Mine keeps turning off or disconnecting. Listen to 1-3 songs and it'll cut off in the middle of a song. Several times an hour sometimes. Tried it where I don't really have much interference, and same exact thing. Tried wearing it one night to listen to music while sleeping, and it just turned off randomly after about 20 minutes of playing. So it paused my music.Take them off and sometimes they'll still keep playing music. Sometimes, I bump into it laying flat on my desk and it'll start playing music. Tap the right side it clear a click, and music will keep playing. Swipe 2-3 times to change songs and it might do it on the first try or never. Neither my car nor my bluetooth speakers have this type of issues. Then sometimes, you adjust them because they feel like they're falling a bit, and you'll trigger the pause.The battery life is pretty good, thankfully. Because it'll stay on sometimes for hours and not turn off. This is with the 15 minutes auto shut down. So you might come back the next morning and it dropped from 90% to 70% because it never turned off.The transparency mode is... just ok. It makes the AC in my office much louder than when I have my headphones off. Like twice as loud. Unless I turn on max wind ANC. But then sound always sound muffled. But even at max transparency and low music volume, I cannot comprehend anyone talking. It sounds like it amplifies constant noise much more than occasional noise.If I wear them while washing dishes, the ANC works really well here too. So it seems to work best with constant noise.The Android App is also extremely slow. You open it, and it has to connect. After it connects, it's unresponsive for another 5 seconds or so. So it takes 10-15 seconds to open settings.I was expecting a quick button to toggle between listening to music, and transparency mode. Right now, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to adjust. Imagine telling someone to wait 20 seconds while you enable the feature, instead of spending 0.5 second removing them.Additional notes: I didn't buy them for the ANC. I care more about low leakage so I'm not disturbing other people in the office. It's also why I wanted transparency mode, so I can still hear other people if they want something.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2022",AGJDE3TR26ZJIIR5CINP4GMUWLCA,TRUE,11,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The only negative (if I'm being picky) would be that I've heard somewhat better noise canceling on other brands but in no way a deal breaker for me.My background is in mix engineering, thus making me hard to impress when it comes to audio products and I'm very happy with these headphones. The default eq curve sounds very pleasant with clean translation on all types of music. The low end is present without an unnatural boost, the mids are clean and defined, and the highs are crisp and silky without causing listening fatigue. The Soundstage is also wide with excellent separation.The app is intuitive with options for all aspects of the product. The only weird thing I've noticed is that boosting frequencies (such as highs or lows for example) using the eq has somewhat of a compression affect on the audio when pushed too heavily. Instead, cutting or lowering unwanted frequencies dials everything in like a champ.Overall I'm extremely satisfied. 👍","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AFOM6TBSTO35DPNHEISJXHADKD3Q,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2EMRYUEWAB9JV,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Too Much Low Bass; Not Ideal for Aircraft Travel,JCW2,4,"Really good sound, clean and clear with great frequency response. The one sad detail is WAY too much low bass. This is not to say it's bad bass, and it reaches much lower frequencies than most phones. It's tight and musical, but it's enough at the bottom end to cause audible distortion in higher frequencies during dense orchestral passages. (This is one reason speaker manufacturers use separate drivers for bass and treble.) I agree with the excellent review by M&N (under ""Other Countries"") except that only a 1 dB reduction in bass is not enough. These phones start to sound reasonably realistic on music with a lot of low bass after a 6 dB bass reduction (the max provided by the equalizer in the app), but I would prefer even more, preferably affecting only the very low end.Another problem potential buyers should consider is that there seems to be ZERO support from the manufacturer for this product. (Part of the problem could be that Sennheiser's consumer products division has been sold to a new company calling itself ""Sennheiser Hearing,"" so they might get this worked out in time.) So it's currently impossible to get operation and usage questions answered. Right now it appears that the equalizer settings are not applied when listening to a wired audio source. Since this is a major application of noise-cancelling phones -- think airplane travel, where Bluetooth is not allowed -- it constitutes a major drawback.Another issue for travel is the heavy, bulky case that comes with these phones. The phones themselves are reasonably compact, weighing about 10.3 oz, but the case is thicker and way stiffer than necessary to protect them and weighs a hefty 13.7 oz, more than doubling the total.Update 03/09/23: Access to technical support is improving lately, at least by telephone. When I finally got hold of them, I was told that, indeed, it is normal function that the phones do NOT apply any user equalization settings when used with an analog (phone-cable) input.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2023",AEPJX4BN6PLNQ7ZQPJYNDJBSBXCA,TRUE,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R10V36NAFXZEZA,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Wanted to Rate This Five Stars,Polarbear,4,"I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use.

So i am not pro in this, but i liked this ones so much, i decided to write a review.I want to start with cons, for me personally, it’s how they falling off when i am working out. Not to confuse you, they are comfortable and “steady” on the head, when you walk, or just laying on the couch. But when im working out it just feels like they are about to fall down my head. I am not sure if this is special problem of this headphones, or just general issue among all over-ear headphones.Except what written above, these headphones are perfect. Especially because of rich/balanced sound, and features in the app. Compared to meze 99 they sound more rich, and better overall, even though meze are wired. And app is on another level, even though i have iphone, its features are surprisingly wide-ranged.

They are not perfect at noise canceling, but they do remove background to the point I can enjoy music or movie while ""escaping from the plane"", yet not be oblivious to the flight attendant offering me dinner. They sound good - not the loudest but that's probably good for long listening. And I can use bluetooth with my Droid, or plug-in to the plane. But a key criterion was battery life.

Sennheiser is well known for this, and definitely live up to expectations here. You can tune them to your liking with an optional bass boost toggle in the app that makes music very punchy, which in my opinion adds a lot to these headphones.While the experience on mobile has been seamless with no issues, the same cannot be said for desktop. Periodically on desktop there is connection dropout with bursts of static upon reconnection.Notwithstanding the connection, this pair of headphones are my first with ANC. I think it works well enough, although from what I've seen it's hardly comparable to Sony's XM5s.The touch controls are sensitive, as many others have said. However, I don't find it to be much of an issue on a day-to-day basis. While having buttons would be nice, I find the touch controls to be rather intuitive and have come to like them.Overall, with the great sound and controls, I can easily say it's worth the price and more than makes up for the slight issues that you may come across when using them.

These might be the most perfect headphones I ever used and I am absolutely an authority when it comes to headphones, as I use them 5 hours a day and have bought every model on the market for 20+ years.The sound is so very clear and I hear frequencies I never heard before in all my old music. Blows away the HD600s. Incredible. Flawless. No other manufacturer can match this, definitely not Sony or even Bose. The closest are the Apple studio headphones but still not really by a very significant margin. Apple did make some very clever in ear wired headphones in 2010 that are fairly close but no longer manufacture those. Forget airpod prosThe ANC is the best I ever heard as well, too good actually I almost got hit by a car. It’s kind of unbelievableNo issues with the bluetooth and it connects to two devices at once without any issues, switching automatically as the sources produce sound. Flawless operation and the app is simple and well thought outThe build quality is perfect. Design is very stylish and classy. Touch sensor almost never goes off by accident.

PERFECTION. These are the best I ever had. In fact these might be the best headphones in the history of the EarthUpdate: Ok they aren’t perfect. What appears to be a firmware bug disables the touch controls randomly and you need to restart the headphones to get them back. Well, whatever. Still 9.999/10Update 2: So the firmware has two major issues.1) You are forced to disable the head sensor because if you take off and then put back the headphones too quickly it disables the touch controls bc of a bug. Unfortunately this means they won’t auto off and your 60 hour battery runs down continuously even without use and might as well be a 10 hours. Facepalm.2) The ANC setting resets every time you recharge and can only be reset from the app. This is deliberate IMO so they force you to keep opening the app bc it’s spyware","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AGNTDROPGCQOTPJUEENZL7KDDR2Q,TRUE,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RKREDCIKWK311,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally...one of the best out there!,James Irmiger,4,"I've been holding off on this review until I lived with these for a while. I got them when they launched and put them head to head against the Bowers & Wilkins, Sony XM4's and 5's, Master & Dynamic, and Dali...all ANC, Bluetooth, etc, etc.. I'll summarize as best I can.In -kinda- the same price range, they all sound good. The Sony's are muddy, the Bowers a little over equalized, the M&D are clear as a bell, but lack bass, and the Dali's are smooth as butter, but have poor construction (broke 2). Finally, the Momentum 4's are a touch bass heavy, but with a little equalization, that goes away and they turn nicely neutral.My biggest gripe was usability, not sound. The 4's have switched to a massive touch surface on the right cup. Normally, I don't mind newer tech, but OMG! Anything getting near them makes a selection. Hair, collars, pillows, you name it. After 7 months, they finally fixed it with firmware 2.13.18. You can now disable the touch controls, but you still can't adjust the sensitivity, or the stock control gestures. Ah well, can't be perfect, but they did also add a new automatic sound tuning feature that really works.I like the sound profile a lot, they're built well for plastic, they have a nice case, ANC is 80% of the big boys, but lacks their cabin pressure, mics are awesome for calls, and a big as heck battery to boot.

R12D0ZLRZ4AQC7,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars So Glad I Ignored the Bad Reviews!!!,HSPS2,5,"I was concerned about the number of medium/bad reviews but went ahead and ordered based on the many excellent reviews and Sennheiser's stellar reputation. After lots of reading, I came to believe that many of the bad reviews resulted from user error and perhaps compatibility/connectivity issues related to the often quirky Apple (iPhone/iPad/iHome) interface. After about one month of using the M4 headphones, I couldn't be happier. Yes, there is a learning curve with the touch controls and Sennheiser's app, especially for us seniors, but with practice, I'm now very comfortable and proficient. FYI, I use the M4's almost exclusively with my late model MOTO phone via bluetooth (android 12). Also, I have other high-end headphones for comparison. Here's what I really like about the M4's:The headphones updated flawlessly (about 25 minutes) right out of the box.The app installed and runs without a hitch - almost zero lag with all adjustments.The M4's connect immediately with my phone and the app, and stay connected.I've never experienced the mysterious ""turning on while in the case"" or when not wearing the headphones.Great Sennheiser sound for my music (Amazon Music). The rich, full sound with pleasant base is enhanced even further when I turn on Dolby Atmos Smart Audio in my phone's settings. (I thought the Sennheiser app might override this feature but it doesn't. I love the sound.)Call sound is very clear. Most people I speak with say they wouldn't know I'm using the headphones.Noise cancelling/transparency has a wide range of adjustment and I can easily shut out the noisy world - it's right up there with the biggest names in noise cancelling.Battery life is unbelievable. OMG, it never seems to go down!The oval, fairly large ear cups cover my large ears without problem.The understated look of the M4's is appreciated. I don't need to be a walking bill-board or get any attention in public.The carrying case is one of the best I've seen - compact, nice padding, stiff. Great protection!The headphones are comfortable to wear for a few hours. There is a little more clamping force than some others, but they stay put.Overall, a great purchase.

From the moment I pulled these from the box I knew I was in for a treat. They have a solid build quality and are lightweight without feeling cheap. The earmuffs are soft and comfortable even wearing glasses.Where these truly shine is sound quality. Right out of the box they sound warm and detailed. With minor adjustments to the EQ through the Sennheiser app they are truly delightful! I played some test tracks and warmed them up with some brown noise for an hour or so, however whether that is necessary or not is debatable.I have not tried calls with them yet but the noise cancelling is quite good. The settings in the app allow you to customize the ANC and unless it is set to automatically adjust, you can change the amount of ANC using touch on the right speaker.Touch controls were easy to use and function as expected. The headphones pause playback if you take the right cup off your ear which could be frustrating for some, but If you want to hear someone, slide the left side off your ear and the media will not pause.Definitely a high quality set of headphones built to last from a brand known for quality. So far I have not experienced any of the app issues others have mentioned. Firmware update went smoothly and took significantly less than the 22min it had initially told me it would take.I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone looking for a quality, well balanced and detailed sounding set of headphones.

R36ZIV2E3IZWRL,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite noise cancelling headphone,WT,5,"I recently added the Momentum 4 to my collection of noise cancelling headphones. The others I currently own are the Sennheiser PXC550, Technics EAH-F70N, Sony WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5. I don't have any Bose headphones because I don't care for their sound signature. For noise cancellation, the Sony XM5 are the best, but only by a small margin over the XM4. However, the XM5's adaptive noise cancellation cannot be turned off and for some, this is a big negative. There are people who want maximum noise cancellation all the time. Not just when they are in very noisy conditions. The Momentum 4 also uses adaptive noise cancellation but unlike the XM5, it can be turned off.For maximum noise cancellation, I prefer the XM5. Especially for long flights. I also carry the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for when I get tired of wearing headphones. In almost all other situations, I prefer the Momentum 4 and Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds for their ""nearly as good"" noise cancellation and superior comfort and sound. I prefer the Sennheiser sound because I find the Sony to be too bright for long listening sessions. They can be fatiguing for me. The Sennheiser sounds more natural, and the sub-bass is really good for a headphone. I also find the Momentum 4 to be more comfortable than the XM5 especially if I wear them for more than an hour or so.Random thoughts:The XM5 is louder than the Momentum 4.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are not as compact as the XM4 and PXC550 respectively.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are the same shape, but the Momentum 4 case is slightly smaller.The Momentum 4 has thicker earpads and are more comfortable than the XM5.The Momentum 4 sub-bass will rattle your brain more than the XM5.The Momentum 4 has an automatic switch-on/off feature that can be somewhat annoying at times.

But for $350+ headphones, I expected more from the audio quality.Am I accustomed to a standalone amp and wired closed-back headphones? Yes. Do I use wireless headphones otherwise? All the time (mostly buds). Do these senheisers blow me away? No.The details in the audio is very solid, but where it lacks is sheer power. Do I intend to blast my ears at full volume? Absolutely not, but with ALL my other wireless headphones, I'm usually floating around half volume, while with these, I'm always a click or two away from full volume, which is crazy... I'm only 35 and have near perfect hearing, so something with these just feels off, like something an update could rectify to unlock a bit more volume capacity. I've heard others trying 3rd party apps to increase volume, which does work, but I find that an annoying workaround.The noise canceling is almost non existent, which I read prior to buying but I was still surprised at their lack of noise canceling ability. Ambient noise is audible, and this is why the volume is an issue, it's a vicious cycle.The touch controls work well but can be a little finicky, especially the autopause feature which stops music upon removing the headphones from your head.Overall, good headphones, but not amazing for the price and those who like to hear their music in louder environments.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AEPQE6ZBDHU2PHPUNTN5CDBSPFNA,TRUE,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Never fails.Not only that, but it keeps cutting off for a split second as well. So annoying!Gotta make a phone call with them? Dropped call, or simply disconnects itself once again. Absolutely hate that.Yeah they’re very nice looking and comfortable, but I wouldn’t buy these again.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AF35GTYH2DMFVCRLVZLAFB7Y5GKQ,TRUE,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
R2KLVLJ9CKHB23,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound. Disappointing build quality.,Robert,3,"The fabric on the top started separating from the headband after only a few months of light use (I rarely wear them anywhere except sitting at my desk). As a result, the very thing that gave these headphones a premium look and feel is now making them look prematurely worn out.I switched to the Sennheisers after a couple of bad experiences with Sony's flagship headphones. If the fabric stops separating where it's at now, I'll probably just live with it; but this is pretty disappointing for a pair of headphones costing anywhere from three to four hundred dollars!From what I can tell, it isn't that all units of this model are afflicted by this specific problem; but there are enough of them out there that there are mentions of it here and elsewhere. It's common enough that there are ""replacement"" headbands from China available online, but I'm not crazy about having to pry apart my headband on my own (and who knows what the quality of these replacements is?).I see that Amazon's added a note to the product page that ""this is a frequently returned item"". NOW they tell me!Short story: if I were starting over, I'd look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2024",AHCXGTUQFTBX33ZF6R6T2YFRH6KQ,TRUE,0,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

As other reviews have mentioned, some of the Bluetooth connections can be a little bit finicky, but after a quick restart everything works as intended (I feel like all Bluetooth headphones do this from time to time).Excellent deep bass, will properly surprise you. I was skeptical because all the other ""deep bass"" headphones I've gotten over the years were puny compared to these. If you aren't a fan of bass, steer clear. If you love a full, rich, bassy sound on all your music, these are for you.Noise cancelling is okay, but I've been spoiled by the AirPods Pro. Nothing can touch those. For the price of these I think the feature is totally adequate, not disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AGX7ALMLJNI3346H3L3XIHVBVR5A,TRUE,2,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R11GZHKSG7BTMU,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars A little disappointed, too far from expectations",Malcolm Sinclair,3,"I must admit, my experience with the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Bluetooth headphones was somewhat disappointing, especially given the high expectations set by others who tout them as the leaders in the industry, even surpassing Sony's XM4-XM5 models. Eager to experience a distinct sound quality, I spent several hours with the Momentum 4 and indeed found their sound to be uniquely different. Compared to my WH820NB, the detail was significantly richer; I could truly feel the presence of each instrument, offering an immersive experience. However, there was an aspect I found unacceptable—the vocals. The vocal reproduction was surprisingly lackluster, sounding flat and almost unnerving. The rich instrumentals and detail seemed to completely overshadow the vocals, resulting in a muffled vocal experience while listening to music. Of course, audio perception is subjective, but I genuinely felt that aside from the detail and presence, the WH820NB performed better in vocal reproduction.On the plus side, the Momentum 4 excels in comfort and battery life. I'm quite fond of the headphones' design—simple yet premium, with a tactile quality that feels far from plasticky. The battery's longevity and the rich EQ options available in the mobile app are commendable features. However, the Bluetooth performance is profoundly disappointing. Whenever the headphones are connected to both a phone and a computer, playback stutters unless one of the connections is turned off. At times, the Bluetooth connection drops out entirely, causing the app to crash upon each attempt to reconnect, necessitating a reset of the Bluetooth pairing. Whether this is a quality control issue or something else, I'm unsure. Moreover, the fact that a driver update takes an entire hour is almost inconceivable.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AH6DM7JGA6NG7D6ZNASFJXSF7MHA,TRUE,5,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RJ00DGF6OSFLW,B0CBLKS51N,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product!,Amazon Customer,5,"I recently purchased the Skullcandy Hesh ANC Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones in True Black, and I'm beyond satisfied with my choice. These headphones are a standout in the realm of audio gear, especially for their price point.One of the major highlights of these headphones is the active noise cancelling (ANC) feature. It works exceptionally well to drown out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience whether I'm at home, commuting, or in a busy café. This feature alone has significantly enhanced my daily routines, letting me enjoy my music without interruptions.The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp, clear highs and deep, punchy bass. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio clarity is consistently excellent. Speaking of calls, the built-in microphone provides clear audio, making it perfect for both taking phone calls and video conferencing.Battery life is another strong point. The headphones offer up to 22 hours of battery life on a single charge with ANC on, which is more than sufficient for several days of heavy use. Plus, they charge relatively quickly, minimizing downtime.The comfort level of the Skullcandy Hesh ANC headphones is also noteworthy. They feature plush ear cushions that are soft and do not exert unnecessary pressure, making them comfortable for long listening sessions. The adjustable headband ensures a good fit for any head size.Additionally, the Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and quick to pair with both iPhone and Android devices, making the setup process seamless and hassle-free. The inclusion of physical buttons for control is a thoughtful touch, allowing for easy adjustments without needing to pull out your phone.Overall, the Skullcandy Hesh ANC Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones are a fantastic value for anyone looking for quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and comfortable design at a reasonable price. They are definitely a wise choice for anyone in the market for robust and reliable headphones.","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2024",AF2N3R6TM7NO5L7F6Z34ZQPOHIUA,TRUE,10,Color: True Black

It is very good but does allow some sound through. I've never heard for myself the ""very best"" of noise cancelling. Voices can be heard, but they sound as thought very far away even when in the same room. Ambient sounds such as fans and keyboards typing are almost not heard at all. With music playing, the distraction level is low.I like the aware mode so I can hear people speaking without removing the head phones. The notifications are spoken.

I’m on the spectrum and daily noise from others angers me, so these are perfect for being able to go about my day without being bothered by others. The noise cancelling is great, and they fit on my head a million times better than any other pair of headphones I’ve tried (which is a LOT). Plus they’re lightweight and super cute!Now that being said, my main reason for purchasing these was to cancel out my noisy neighbors early morning nonsense since I’m an incredibly light sleeper. While these work great for just that, I noticed the first night that if you lay your head on your side, you’ll get jump scared with an incredibly high pitched and loud squeak of feedback from the microphone. I found out it’s due to them being fairly cheap, and since theres mics on BOTH sides, it’s pretty unavoidable if you’re a side sleeper. If you’re a stomach or back sleeper, you’ll be fine and they do an incredible job and are super comfortable to sleep in. But as a stomach and side sleeper, I was incredibly disappointed to find this out.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2024",AGP7E63DRLXU2DZBYTCJQYQGPHEA,TRUE,2,Color: Mod White

RVF1HFSWBNC9M,B09ZXXYRKY,5.0 out of 5 stars Search is over. We have a winner!,GiovanniMo,5,"I tried Sony XM5, Bose Q700, Sennheiser M4, Airpod Max, Technics A800, Beats Studio Wireless. They all have strengths and weaknesses but I could only afford to keep one. Whichever one I chose I was going to have to decide which little imperfection I could live with. And there’s so much more that goes into it besides sound quality. There’s ANC, controls, comfort, portability, connection etc.My biggest priorities were sound quality and, due to a broken arm a while back and lingering nerve damage in my fingers, the controls.I’m kind of an audiophile so I’m really picky with sound. Rock, Jazz, ambient, folk. Etc.These had the best and most natural sound quality by far. Nothing phony added to try and beef it up no heavy sound signature and tuning. Just super clarity and natural punchy bass. Sennheiser was a really close second. Third Apple. Fourth Bose. I know Sony has its fans, and there’s a lot to like, but I found it a little muffled and overly compressed. The Bowers and Wilkins brought out details and channel separation and still had a balanced and full sound. The bass didn’t swallow up the rest of the sound like some of the others. I love these.I surprisingly found the noise canceling to be almost on par with the Bose. And these rivaled the Apple air Max in terms of build quality. These BWs are also really comfortable and I forget that I’m wearing them. The case is also high end with a cool little storage compartment inside.And now the controls. The headphones with the easiest controls for my situation were the Apple AirPod Max. One button/dial. Clickable not haptic. Awesome. Loved it. But the sound quality was not nearly as nice, they were kinda heavy…and they were the most expensive. By a lot. The Beats also had great controls …But the sound was not even really in the ballpark of all the others. All the others had touch controls that I found very frustrating. Sennheiser was probably the easiest of the touch controls but the stupid power button and shutting them on/off was an adventure every time.The Bowers and Wilkins have buttons which were a little tricky for the first couple days but thankfully the center button has ridges to distinguish it from the other same-shape-size buttons. So after getting used to it for a day or so it was easier to live with than the others.The two cons with these which I find easy to forgive are the app only has Bass and treble…no eq. And the wear sensor, which senses when you take them off and pauses the music, will often malfunction. Luckily this is easily fixed. You can just disable it in the app and then they work flawlessly. And because they have physical and clickable buttons, pausing them and shutting them off is way easier than all the other ones.I bought them in blue. Very cool. My teenage daughter, who swears by her Air Pod Maxes, even admitted that these sound way better and look great…just not as cool as her maxes:)Anyway this is a long review because I spent weeks trying them all and it was important to my lifestyle. If you try these you need to be patient and let the simplicity and nuance of the sound settle in. It won’t blow you away with bass or make it sound like you’re in a noise deprivation chamber like the Bose…They have a mature and exciting sound and BW nailed it!I cannot recommend these enough and I feel confident that I picked the best ones for me.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2023",AFHWK3NU3CKIUDZ6OMHYL37O6BOQ,TRUE,145,Color: Blue

Compared to the Px7 S2s, the XM5s sound muddy and condensed, whereas the Px7 S2s feel expansive and crisp, while maintaining a robust lower register of bass to fill out the overall soundstage.I'll cover 5 main areas in this review, often comparing the Px7 S2s to my experience with the Sony WH-1000XM5s (XM5s), the Airpods Max's (APMs), and the first-generation B&W Px7s:1. Sound Quality2. Build Quality3. Bluetooth & Corded Connection Technology4. Included Case5. New Bowers & Wilkins App— SOUND QUALITY —I should preface this by saying that I purchased the Px7 S2s to be my listen-at-home-for-best-sound-quality-using-bluetooth headphones. I have a pair of open-back Beyerdynamic 990s that I use to mix and produce music, my XM5s for traveling and phone/video calls, the APMs (which I've since returned), the in-ear Sony WF-1000XM4s for the gym and exercising, and now these new Px7 S2s from B&W (which I'll just call ""S2s"" from here on).It took a little time for the S2s to ""run in"", basically like ""breaking in"" any pair of headphones, over the course of about 24 hours of listening time – and the sound really just got better and better. I noticed better channel separation over time, especially when listening via the corded connection and internal DAC to get true HiFi sound (using TIDAL).I did adjust the EQ in the app over time, basically increasing the bass by 4.5 dB and the treble by 2.5 dB to get even more dialed in to the sound I prefer. Now, the S2s offer an impressively wide soundstage with a level of detail and precision that I've never heard in any other pair of wireless headphones. The highs are clear and articulate, while the mids remain warm and rich, providing an incredibly immersive listening experience. I also appreciate that the S2s don't sacrifice bass response in pursuit of clarity; the low-end is powerful and well-defined, never overpowering or muddy. As a true audiophile, I can confidently say that the S2s deliver a level of Hi-Fi audio quality that is unmatched in the wireless headphone market.— BUILD QUALITY —When it comes to build quality, the S2s are simply outstanding. Crafted from a high-quality plastic that feels almost indistinguishable from aluminum or other light metals, the entire build of the headphones exudes a premium feel. The materials used make them lightweight yet durable, perfect for extended listening sessions without discomfort. The ear cups are plush and comfortable, providing excellent passive noise isolation. The S2s also boast a sleek and elegant design, making them as visually impressive as they are sonically.— BLUETOOTH & CORDED CONNECTION TECHNOLOGY —The S2s feature the latest Bluetooth technology, ensuring a stable and high-quality wireless connection. I've experienced no latency issues or connection drops, making for a seamless listening experience. The inclusion of a USB-C to 3.5mm cord and a USB-C to USB-C cord allows users to enjoy Hi-Res music quality, which is a fantastic addition for those who desire the best possible audio experience. I find that using the corded connection with the built-in DAC delivers superior sound quality compared to Bluetooth alone, especially when listening to lossless audio formats such as FLAC or TIDAL's Dolby Atmos tracks.— INCLUDED CASE —The Px7 S2s come with a fantastic case that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The case is smaller and less bulky than the XM5s, making it easier to carry around without taking up too much space. Made from a nice canvas-type material, the case feels durable and offers excellent protection for your headphones. The case is far superior to the AirPods Max's, which don't even come with a case, and it's clear that Bowers & Wilkins put thought into creating a case that is both protective and stylish.— NEW BOWERS & WILKINS APP —The Bowers & Wilkins music app is a fantastic addition to the Px7 S2 experience. The app enables you to adjust EQ settings, including treble and bass, allowing you to fine-tune your listening experience to your preferences. Additionally, the app integrates multiple streaming platforms like TIDAL, Spotify, and Soundcloud into one centralized music hub, making it easy to access and enjoy all your favorite music from a single location.I particularly appreciate the ability to listen to TIDAL's Dolby Atmos songs in a standard FLAC format, which sounds much better to my ears. The app is user-friendly and responsive, and I find it to be a valuable tool in getting the most out of my Px7 S2s.— FINAL THOUGHTS —Ultimately, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2 over-ear headphones have exceeded my expectations in every way. With unparalleled sound quality, exceptional build quality, versatile connection options, a fantastic case, and a highly functional app, the Px7 S2s have quickly become my go-to headphones for enjoying Hi-Fi audio at home. As an audiophile, I can confidently say that these headphones offer a listening experience that is unmatched in the wireless market. If you're seeking a truly premium audio experience, look no further than the Px7 S2s.","Reviewed in the United States April 19, 2023",AFWSGTTZAA73BVVFYG4WT5QA3W4A,TRUE,59,Color: Grey
R22R7Y5D7KCF2J,B09ZXXYRKY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Top notch, high quality sound and build.",Joseph Dalessandro,5,"My old headphones finally died out. (JBL's) Been researching for quite some time to replace.Looked at the Sony's, didn't care for the touch controls, I prefer buttons. Looked at and purchased the Bose's QC 45's. NC was top notch, sound quality was also very good. However, the build quality left a little to be desired. Not that they were bad, just didn't feel like high end headphones.The Bowers & Wilkins checked all the boxes. Quality sound. The best of all the headphones I tested. Deep bass, clean midrange, crisp highs. Quality build. These felt like premium headphones should. Nice materials, very solid build. They are a little heavier, but I believe that is from the quality materials that were used. The NC is where they get a 4 star rating. Having used the Bose QC 45's I would say they have the better NC. Not that the B&W are bad, just that the Bose's are better in that department. Comfortability. I wear these for watching movies late at night. They are quite comfortable. 4 or 5 hour late night TV binges with no issues. Ears do start to sweat but I haven't found a pair of headphones that don't have that issue. Battery life is good as well. So far, anywhere from 25 to 30 hours of use time with ANC on. The B&W app is a little lacking, no EQ, unlike the Bose. So I will give that category to Bose as well.Overall, I am very satisfied with my B&W Px7 S2 headphones. Would highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023",AFZVQEDT4PT2MKWDOL2UILZOD4XQ,TRUE,8,Color: Blue
RGX0PO5CP18AF,B09ZXXYRKY,"1.0 out of 5 stars Started off great, but went downhill within a year. I’m done.",Rob,1,"Final Update: I purchased and received replacement earpads from a suspect looking website as instructed by Bowers & Wilkins support, which ended up working out. I also ordered an extra ear pad for when I need it in the future. But now the leather on the top of the headphones is coming off. It’s a shame, these were great sound, excellent battery life, and all around really solid. But the cosmetic defects are continuing to pile up, so I’m done with Bowers and Wilkins. Definitely not something I’d expect for headphones in this price range. Very disappointing for a premium product I purchased just under a year ago.Second Update: Now one of the earpads has started coming off in the last couple months. This is disappointing (I originally purchased these 10 months ago) and normally wouldn’t be an issue, however replacing them appears to be very difficult. The only options on Amazon seem to have low reviews and are not OEM parts, and the B&W website directs me to outside sellers who end up not having the parts. Also, their website has a page for PX7 earpads, but I’m not even sure if these fit the PX7 S2 like I have. This makes me long for the days when I had Bose QC25 headphones where replacing the earpads was a pain but at least I could easily obtain them!Update: They recently issued a software update that’s corrected my only issue with these headphones. Now they’re great! I also forgot to mention some other benefits. Very solid storage case, and I appreciate theist they have all the necessary cables included. They battery life is awesome at 30 hours as it’s better than the 20 hours offered by AirPods Max and Bose 700. They’re comfortable and the app is easy enough to navigate. No regrets!Original review: These headphones have mostly been great. I did a lot of research before purchasing them and they’ve generally lived up to the hype. I bought them about 5 months ago without issues. I had originally purchased the AirPods Max but found those to be a little heavy, have less battery life, and the condensation issue in the ear cups, so I returned those. The B&W PX7 S2 was a welcome change from those issues. Now I’m experiencing a strange issue where the battery level always shows as 37%. I’ve tried different USB-C cables and adapters, but my batter level won’t change. I’ve read others having this issue online without resolution. For the price you’d think this would be happen. Hopefully it resolves on its own after I try one more factory reset.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2023",AELKGKRIEK63GJ3RABNPZM652NVQ,TRUE,13,Color: Black
R1UHMV950FHR6C,B09ZXXYRKY,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great design, disappointing sound",Trevor Burnham,4,"I tried both the PX7 S2 and its luxe-priced sibling, the PX8. There's a lot to love about these headphones: They have a high-end look and feel. The controls are easy to use. The ANC works great. The app is best-in-class. The only thing I don't love is the sound, which suffers from muddy bass on several tracks I tested. (Some examples: ""Everything Now"" by Arcade Fire and ""Get Lucky"" by Daft Punk.) The bass is so bad that those songs sound better to me on my 3rd-gen AirPods—which are great earbuds, but it's shocking to see them outperform a full-sized headphone at this price point.Now, that's just over Bluetooth. When I listened to the B&W headphones plugged in to a headphone amp, the muddy sound disappeared. So if you're looking for all-purpose headphones that you can plug in at home and occasionally use for travel, these are a fine option. But if you're looking for first-class sound, you'll be disappointed.Some alternatives to consider:* The AirPods Max is, to my ears, the best-sounding headphone in this price range. It's distinctly bass-heavy, and the ultra-minimalist design is divisive, but it's an absolute must-try.* The B&W PX8 suffers from the same sound quality issues as its relatively affordable sibling. In fact, I couldn't hear any difference between the two. I did prefer the leather earpads on the PX8 over the foamy pads on the PX7 S2, though.* The Mark Levinson No. 5909 is the best-sounding wireless headphone I've tried, period, but is also the most expensive. It's also bulkier than the B&W and has worse ANC.* The Focal Bathys are super-comfortable and have a smooth, balanced sound, but cost twice as much as the PX7 S2.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2022",AFJNXZCVFG7LBSETC7TUURSJAYTA,TRUE,15,Color: Black
R36SLZ27K4X69J,B09ZXXYRKY,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive,Casper,5,"As a part time audiophile, I do search for products that I find eye opening at less than painful price range. I’m not about to delve into the world of upper echelons of audio due to financial reasons but I found these headphones to be impressive. I’m a wired-headphone kinda guy. They do, by fact and science, sound better. These being wireless and sounding the way they do is what caught my attention. I’ve never owned any B&W products. Now they have a customer for life. Apparently these have the ability to be listened to wired as well, I have yet to try it.Now, one thing has caught my attention (which I provide a photo). I don’t know if I got an opposite of a lemon device or what but I’d consider this a golden apple. I’ve used these at my job almost every day. I’ve had these since September 5th. I haven’t charged them ONCE. They still haven’t died. I’d say the battery is life is incredible on these.The sound quality is very good. Being wireless and battery powered, they aren’t as loud as I’d like it, but that’s only because, again, I have wired headphones I use on my PreSonus Central Station (Philips Fidelios, Beats Pro *the all metal ones, not those plastic pos*). You can hear the power behind it as far as volume and detail. But nonetheless they do sound ALMOST on par with the wired headphones I have, so very very nice.I haven’t had much experience with noise cancellation so I don’t have much of an opinion on it. But so far, these are the best I’ve had.And lastly. Their appearance. They just look good. I love the color, design, shape, and feel. They are comfortable. I was worried about some of the reviews with the quality control/build issues, but I could care less honestly. As long as they play music at their intended quality, I’m happy.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AHAQEO4QYLC6MGILYQ3NPATRX4WQ,TRUE,7,Color: Blue

Short version: There's no noticeable lag between video and audio and they look, feel, and sound great.The slightly longer version: I originally bought a pair of Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, which also looked and sounded great, but there was a very noticeable delay between what I was seeing and hearing. I did a little research and discovered it was because the newer Sony headphones no longer use or support the aptX codec. That codec is apparently necessary for low latency audio over bluetooth so you don't have the disconnect between video and audio.After learning that, I read some reviews of bluetooth heaphones with aptX adaptive support and settled on these. The construction of the headphones and the case they're stored in is top notch. They look great (I bought the blue version) and feel very comfortable even after long listening sessions. The noise cancellation works well, too. The only thing I can't speak to is the quality of the microphone for phone calls, as I haven't made any with these yet.

R1WY46U71RTZ1H,B09ZXXYRKY,2.0 out of 5 stars Grandpa PX is disappointed,Jay Mendoza,2,"This review is for the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 (Blue) .TL;DR │ I've been using the original PX. These are frustrating to use. The wear-sensor is garbage — pauses when worn; doesn't pause when removed.⁽ⁿ⁰⁾ The button layout ergonomics are inferior⁽ⁿ¹⁾ but have better functions.⁽ⁿ²⁾ The small kinks of PX are still not resolved here.⁽ⁿ³⁾ Subjectively inferior colors and materials (I had the Bowers & Wilkins PX (Gold/Blue) ).⁽ⁿ⁴⁾CONTENTS: Intro │ What I Like │ What I Don't Like │ Package │ Notes │ Verdict- - - - -As a long-time PX user, I was very much interested in upgrading to the newer version. Surely, it can only get better, right? Right? After a couple of months of thinking, I decided I wanted these. I skipped the first version of PX7 because that looked like a downgrade to me, and did not have a blue color option. Well, these are, without a doubt, still a downgrade. I bought these at a higher price, and the usability is frustrating.WHAT I LIKE │ + │+ Sound is still great. ""Crisp bass.""+ USB-C charging and playback.+ aptX Adaptive.

The PX just works, maybe 95% of the time. The PX7 S2 at best works a third of the time. There are three sensitivities, and none of them made any significant differences in the experience. Pauses A LOT when worn. When removed, half the time it does not pause, the other half, it literally takes 2 seconds to pause (so people can hear your music). When worn back, does not resume most of the time. This is a disgrace because B&W got it working on the PX. Their support site actually recommends just turning it off. In fact, it is OFF by default. It also does not seem to ""wake up"" the headphones.⁽ⁿ¹⁾ The power button was moved where the volume-up button was on the PX. This would be fine, but now, the volume-down button sits very low that it is awkward to press. Also, I do prefer the PX's ""bump"" for the middle multifunction button. The PX7 S2's middle button is just ribbed, which is a lot harder to distinguish in my opinion...⁽ⁿ²⁾ ...but at least now, it is a lot less confusing to turn the headphones off. If you've used the PX, you'll know what I'm talking about. Also, the multi-function button has moved to the left and is now able to switch between ANC, pass-through, or off. I always found it stupid that I have to dig through the non-responsive app to activate pass-through. They had it done this way, all the way through their PI7.⁽ⁿ³⁾ The app still has this issue: The app sometimes could not find the headphones, EVEN WHEN IT IS ALREADY CONNECTED and playing music.⁽ⁿ⁴⁾ There is too much blue, too less metal. Looks less classy, more casual. However, I do like that the looks and the profile of the headphones when worn which is a lot more compact. I'd say even when there is more blue and less gold, it is a more muted design. It does feel more solid even though it is not metal, and having a broken metal weld on the PX, I would say, it should hold better in time.⁽ⁿ⁵⁾ If the battery dies, it's brick. A very expensive e-waste brick.⁽ⁿ⁶⁾ This means I cannot use most third-party audio cables anymore. There are third-party cables, but it's a lot tougher to find one that would work and one that you actually like.- - -VERDICT: I ""kinda"" recommend this product.★★☆☆☆ | 2 stars out of 5.

R5DBI3N7C2ANJ,B09ZXXYRKY,4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones: they're the one for me,Commodity Junkie,4,"The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2 rewards you with a generous sound stage and excellent instrument separation. Classical and acoustic music gain the most from these cans, even as decent bass support provides full playback to other genres - hip hop, punk rock, and techno. (As a rule of thumb, the more layers and instruments that a track contains, the more rewarding your experience). The ambient pass-through ANC mode is the best to stick with when listening to music.The noise cancellation is decent enough - they certainly work much better than foam earplugs. But I don't really ask much of it as I don't wear these outdoors. I mainly use them to listen to music or videos on my desktop PC via a 15' USB C cable, to take advantage of the motherboard's high end audio chipset.The sound quality with these wired is notably superior to the experience when paired via Bluetooth. The build quality is superb with aesthetics, comfort, and workmanship worthy of the price. It's as premium a headphone in sound quality that you can get, without the extra aluminum, leather, and weight of pricier models.Bluetooth connectivity with my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra used to work most of the time, but it failed often when the Wear Sensor software was enabled. It kept cutting out as if I was removing the headphones from my head, while they were still sitting on top. I'm glad to note, however, this problem has been resolved with app version 2.1.5.While the the noise cancellation button works great, the on and off switch is a tad too small for me. But that's my only gripe, really.This was a major upgrade from my previous cans, a Grado Prestige SR80 and an Audio Technica ATH-M40x (both in the $100-range). I'm happy I purchased the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2. I bought these mainly for use with my PC, and they perform marvelously in this regard while they also provide for a solid Bluetooth performance. These are, without a doubt, the best upgrade to my listening experience in over a decade.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2022",AHVINPL4ETAT6C6K3BDVDEA6CEYA,TRUE,21,Color: Black

The sound quality is pretty good, they're light and comfortable, and I was impressed by the noise canceling and battery life.The thing that spoils all this is that fact that, about a month after purchasing these and despite careful wear and storage, the point where the soft headphones connect with the plastic of the headphones' body came loose, starting as a small seam but quickly growing until the foam material underneath was visible. It seems that the attachment point is extremely thin and poorly attached, so I've had to resort to using a strip of gorilla tape to re-attach the headphones to the body of the device, otherwise they would likely come off entirely.I reached out to Bowers & Wilkils through their site on May 17th, but never heard back about this. Overall, these offer good sound quality and life, but I would say that you should be prepared to repair them if you plan to wear them often.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AEDJIBORLPH5KK5UKSGL3S3TO44Q,TRUE,0,Color: Black

With my previous PX7 experience thought to give a try as PX7 S2 are new version and may got some improvements. My first impression these were improved in many ways from PX7’s. Design is the stellar with minimalist feel and stylish look. My is a small head so not many fits me perfectly. But these headphones fits like a head glove for me. Material feels high quality premium. Fits very well and the clamp force is perfectly distributed. Important thing sound quality is mind blowing. For who ever looking for bass heavy headphones like me, these are for them. Note: it’s not too much overwhelming bass. We feel a tight bass feels good and pleasant to listen for longer duration. Can adjust the bass and treble in the app if needed.

RQB17NLKQUFMY,B09ZXXYRKY,2.0 out of 5 stars Read the reviews and know the battery issues are true,Kindle Customer,2,"I’d like to first say I was an avid Bose user. I took a chance in some B&O earbuds and was hooked. I still used my Bose 700s and thought and upgrade was in order. I first looked and B&O and followed the reviews. I checked with Bowers & Wilkins and found the Px7 S2 were comparable to the Bose 700s. My main focus was on noise cancellation and the Bower & Wilkins were slightly inferior. What sold me was the 30 hour battery life and comfort vs my Bose 700s.Out the box without a charge they lasted 32 hours. Yes, the noise cancellation is not as good as Bose 700s, but everything else about them was superior. From the fit to the sound quality the Px7 S2 were the headphones for me.Well after 2 months of use the battery refuses to hold a charge past 12 hours even after 24 hours of charging. I went online and found how to reset them and followed the instructions on the two different ways to reset.After this fruitless endeavor I contacted Bowers & Wilkins customer support. Paying $380 for headphones does not mean you will get any better customer service. They have dealt strictly by email and went as far to say you can call us to talk to us but we will never call you. After a couple of weeks talking back and forth they accept the issue is the battery and my warranty was valid.I received an email telling me to ship them to Bowers & Wilkins and a replacement will be sent. No, they will not cover shipping of the defective pair and no you will not be reimbursed. So fair warning to all, if your headphones are defective plan on paying $30- $40 in shipping fees on tops for the $350+ you paid for the headphones.In closing may I say excellent headphones, but I will never buy Bowers & Wilkins again. Their customer service while polite is dismal at best. If you have read this and had a better experience, I’m happy for you, but if you have shared my experience please spread it far and wide.The reviews were correct and the batteries in the headphones are a luck of the draw.","Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2023",AH5DZC5EEYAWZYBCY5P2TKUUYYHQ,TRUE,3,Color: Black
R1O94T0FQIVJ3I,B09ZXXYRKY,5.0 out of 5 stars Preferred to Sony,Palinor,5,"I bought both these and the Sony WH-1000XM4, and auditioned the XM5 at Best Buy. I really wanted to like the XM4s best as the noise cancelling is significantly better, they fold a little smaller and don't look and feel as cheesy as the XM5s, but I just couldn't get past the fact that these B&Ws sound better. I fiddled for hours with the Sony app dialing in all the suggested settings recommended in countless online discussions, but no matter what I did the Sonys placed the sound squarely inside my head, while the B&Ws placed the sound outside in front and around me. The Sonys were incredibly detailed but a little harsh; these B&Ws just sound nice, and ooze quality.One disappointment, which is minor, is that when connected to my Pixel 7a with a USB cable (i.e. digitally hardwired) the sound is flat and dead. I'd expected that configuration to be better than using bluetooth, but it wasn't. I don't know why and haven't looked into it further as bluetooth sounds so good. My other minor complaint is that when first paired there is a little jitter for a few seconds; this didn't occur using the Sonys.All this said, my wife preferred the XM4s, so she kept those while I took the B&Ws.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2023",AGGSWDDOAIW4ISFWJ6KFGL6Y22IQ,TRUE,6,Color: Black
RP8LKSCU43REX,B09ZXXYRKY,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones with build quality issues,Brent,4,"Love these headphones. They're comfortable, sound great and the battery holds a long charge.The problem is I've owned these for just over 4 months now and the earpads are already falling apart. The lining that holds the memory foam pad has almost completely come undone (the lining seems to be secured with the smallest amount of glue). I don't exercise or walk around in these, they sit comfortably on my head while I work my desk job. I've owned a number of headphones over the years such as bose and sony and I know earpads need replaced after a few years but 4 months? I called customer service thinking that a premium brand would do right by their customers since this is clearly a quality control issue but I was wrong: it's not covered under warranty and I was forwarded to an external distributor to purchase replacement parts, $14 per earpad +$6 shipping by the way.These are some of the most expensive wireless headphones on the market ($400 at the time of writing this) and I think it's ridiculous to not take responsibility for quality control issues but instead ask your customers to buy replacement parts within the first year of ownership.

RGJIIZT6B85SF,B09ZXXYRKY,"1.0 out of 5 stars So disappointed. Only pairs 2 devices! Too many flaws. UPDATED, worse than I even thought",Kelly Staples,1,"Astounding. How can B&W be so shortsighted?Firstly, there is NO desktop app. So you must plug in and pair through computer bluetooth, which wouldn't be a problem IF I didn't have to ""forget"" it in order to use either of my mobile devices: iPad and iPhone where I spend most of my time. But I use all 3 interchangeably.And what if you have also have sound system or TV to pair? You're screwed.Next, the headband is too big. I have a pretty large head for a women (I wear L hat size) and yet just to keep these on I must tighten them all the way and they still are not snug enough for the NC to perform well. In fact, I just realized that my AirPods Pro buds even NC better than these! Ironically, the AirPods Max were too tight and felt like a vice grip on my cheeks.I'm disappointed because the blue color is beautiful and the sound quality is terrific. But the app situation is lame and the pairing limitations are deal breaker. I'm sending them back.FTR, I've tried AirPods Max, both Bose 45 & 700, & Sony. None of them are particularly impressive.I've decided to just use my AirPods Pro for everything as the NC on these are no more impressive & the sound quality on the buds are amazing. Who'd of thunk it? Airbuds Pro are better than all overear NC?I had an old pair of wired Bose for 20 years and they were truly amazing until the earpads finally wore out because I slept in them all the time. Our throw away society has produced some incredibly substandard products.UPDATE: customer service responded with a solution that did not work and new problems/shortcomings arose. See communique with my last response to troubleshooting:Yeah doesn’t work. Had been using in iphone & saw mac connected since it was other connected device. But after setting up 3rd device (ipad) it no longer plays on iphone that I was last using. In fact, it would only see Macbook twice on ipad after I switched to it. Back to iphone it knows it’s there cuz I got a prompt that it dropped when I had to reboot headphones to get them to even go back on because they keep shutting off when no sound playing, which is also unacceptable since NC is auto-off after a few minutes of silence! Seems no way to turn that off? I fall asleep to a meditation and when it’s over NC goes off and I wake to environmental noise. Not good. None of the other brands do this either. Now on iphone I have to reconnect then ipad disappears. Macbook seems always connected I guess? Maybe since I had to connect via cable and not an app or wireless?These are going back sadly. Bluetooth connectivity is just too problematic and poorly designed. Auto off unacceptable. Headband is weak so NC is also weak.Seriously disappointed in B&W.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023",AHIHJTPTXNB2WQR7ZXH75WQJOZWQ,TRUE,12,Color: Blue
R3U7H1UPNW3T2F,B09ZXXYRKY,3.0 out of 5 stars Loved them and sent them back,JoeZilla,3,"Sending these back was a hard decision. They sound fantastic, albeit a little bass heavy (more bass guitar!). Instrument separation is great, the sound stage is fantastic, the build quality is there, they look great. And it's not giving even more money to Apple.But I found the noise cancellation to be too glitchy. Here's two examples:1) The left side made a crackling popping noise when you adjusted the ear cup or pushed on it. It must be the air pressure changes, because it did the same thing on an airplane during landing. Annoying, but could've lived with it.2) Commuting into NYC is a great test for a set of cans. Sadly, especially on NJ Transit busses, the ANC kept cutting in and out every time the bus hit a bump. The ANC works great in an office environment of a quiet room though, and even walking through the city it was mostly ok.Did it drop the connection on calls every now and then? Yes, but not often.The app? Perfectly fine.If I didn't have to commute every now and then, I would've kept them. But I need them to work on a bus.

The s2 and m4 are my favorites for sound quality as I've mentioned but it's different. I would compare to the px7 s2 being elegant like a country club where as the momentum 4 is the rockstar. They both have great separation and soundstage but the Px7 s2 is a bit wider and the bass is tighter with less sub bass vs the m4 is more bass boosted. They both have an app that gives the option for eq-ing the audio. So for me the Px7 s2 is more on the audiophile side for critique listening where as the momentum 4 is just fun. I do want to mention I go for the Px7 s2 more than the m4 because they have physical buttons where the m4's have touch/swipe controls which is frustrating at times.","Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2022",AGUKIMHYW3GLEAU2UNDMO3ZW47WA,TRUE,16,Color: Black
RU6FH2DU6V8CD,B09ZXXYRKY,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable B&W headphones offer clear sound with less bass liveliness,Shannon,5,"I was apprehensive when I bought these headphones to replace my Bose QuietComfort 35 II. Having read and watched numerous reviews, I was prepared to compromise on comfort. I also anticipated sharper sounds with greater separation, bass that was less overpowering, and noise cancellation that was less effective. Given my eclectic music taste, which ranges from psytrance and electronic to rock and jazz, I was anxious about how the headphones would handle the different genres. I tend to avoid excessive bass as it causes me headaches and detracts from other components, especially in electronic music with multiple layers. Another concern was comfort, but to my surprise, these headphones felt more comfortable than my previous Bose ones, although I have smaller ears. However, I can imagine that people with larger ears might find them less comfortable as there seems to be less space. By adjusting the treble and bass in the B&W app, I'm now able to hear each element of songs that previously seemed jumbled together. These headphones are perfect for those who prefer musical component differentiation over powerful bass. In my personal opinion, I have no regrets about buying these headphones, they are the best I have ever owned.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2023",AFRFKL4UO3D4GEQ2YIPHXWT3DYJQ,TRUE,5,Color: Grey

I have the Bose Q45 and the B & W Px7 S2 Over-Ear Headphones (2022 Model). Bose beats easily B & W. How do I know? I was on my land mower testing the B & W for ANC. I had to take it off and put on my Bose Q45 because the mower's noise was in my ear like I have no ANC on at all. On the other hand, when proceeding with the Bose Q45, I still have some noise but not as much as the very expensive B & WPx7 S2.The bottom line, B & W needs to back to the drawing board and mimic what Bose does as far as noise canceling is concerned. Their sound quality is magnificent. And no company should dare call the technology noise canceling. They should it Noise Reducer because it's next to impossible to completely eliminate all noise.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2023",AGIABLP3H7SGL2LT7UGJQH4MYR4Q,TRUE,5,Color: Blue

I never worked out in these and never worn the headphones with a sweaty head. At this price point, I'm disappointed how fast the materials are coming off.

Hill,3,"Got these to replace an earlier pair of B&S Px7 (non-S2) headphones that started making noise in one ear cup (conveniently out of warranty). Overall these have good sound quality and good noise cancellation. However, they have a couple of design flaws that I find disappointing:-- The build quality is poor. After a year the material in the headband is separating from the band itself.-- The headphones go into some form of power saving after not being used, the only way to wake them up is to toggle power off and then on again. Confusing, since the power switch is a ON and yet they are OFF.-- The buttons are located towards the back of the ear cup. The result is that is you rest your head back on a high backed chair its far too easy to trigger the pause button my mistake (which stands out higher than the others).Overall, this doesnt seem inspired design to me. Why headphone makers (except Apple) have so much trouble with the simple arrangement of buttons and LEDs on headphones is beyond me. Given the price point I would expect better build quality, and given that I've had TWO pairs fail in different ways I would not recommend these, good though the sound is.

The wear sensor was a huge let down when I bought these in fall of 2022, the feature never worked right out of the box and most people just turned the feature off. You could be sitting at your desk and a slight turn of your head would pause playback because the headphone thought you removed them from your head. Now after the update the wear sensor is a lot more accurate. It'll pause when removing the headphones. I can lift one earcup from my ear and it'll pause as advertised. The other annoying issue fixed by the update is with the app on the phone. In my case it was with the iPhone. When turning on the headphones, the B&W app would auto-launch on your phone screen. Very annoying. With the new update, that ""feature"" is now removed.

Highly recommend for anyone with the luck of 1,000 pure blood leprechaun.Let me start by saying if you get a good pair of this headphone then you will most likely enjoy the PX7 S2 a whole lot. If you are like me then you will be struck with a mix of bad luck and poor quality control on these headphones. I tried 4 different pairs, 3 through amazon and one bought local at a hi-fi shop. First two pairs had a massive bend from where the left ear cup touches the headband, making them both sit uneven on my face and creating pressure points and losing any semblance of a seal on my ears. I thought, maybe it was the same batch the s/n's were extremely close, like within 50 of each other so hey maybe it's just a weird mold problem. Gave the headphones another shot in store, the person their let me open the box and inspect the headphones, PERFECT they aren't bent out of shape and fit me just fine. So those get home, within two days while I'm doing dishes with the ANC on I tapped a glass or dropped a spoon and instead of the ANC blocking out the noise, even just a little passive blocking it boosted that noise right back into my ears and nearly made me fall over in pain to the point where I had liquid feeling in my ear. So thought, maybe let's try again, the other ones sounded great and didn't have this issue but the build was off, so fourth times a charm as they say. Let's just say it wasn't, This new pair, in a third color might I add, has the same earcup problem as the first two and now also has what seems to be a bunk battery.

She said there was a bit too much bass. she said they didn't quite sound as good as her airpods pro. My ex wife listened and was not impressed. She has the Sennheiser hd598 and the Sennheiser tws momentum 3. she liked those better.She said the PX7 S2 were ok. I think it's a matter of different strokes for different folks. My daughter's and ex wife's use case was not a fit for the headphones which I never thought about when buying them. So I returned them and bought my daughter another gift. Again this is a second hand review. That being said they both have excellent ears. So for the most part I trust what they say.

Everything sounds like it's coming through a wet cloth, and there is NO bass to speak of. I thought maybe i was just uneducated and bass wasnt supposed to be strong but this is so weak it detracts from the song (and that's after i turned it up to the max in the Bowers & Wilkins app).Also, the noise canceling is extremely inadequate - I could still hear the click of my mouse, which is not a loud sound and is easily covered by other headphones with anc. Reviewers said this had such an expansive soundstage and I think they must have all been delirious because it basically sounds like it's all in one ""beam"" of sound, if you ask me.I am not even remotely an audiophile, but even I can tell you right now that my 3 year old $99 skullcandy hesh anc headphones easily outdo these in both sound and (by miles) anc.

None of these issues line up with the price tag. I have tried almost all of the over ear noise cancelling headphones in this price range and these are the only ones to give me any sort of trouble.The last thing that kills them for me is that they are completely unusable when not powered, so in a couple of years when the batteries are dead, you won't be able to plug them into something with a headphone jack and still use them, they'll just be $400 of e-waste.These are so close to being great, but they just aren't.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2022",AGFZN4XTBLWJVS5WEYPKRCNLP7GQ,TRUE,19,Color: Blue

For each one I purchased, one earpiece stopped working after approximately 6 months. They look nice, are comfortable, and the sound quality is relatively good. But for some reason, with normal use, one earpiece always stops working after a relatively short period of time. This makes the product useless. This headset is expensive, and one expects it to last at least a few years. If I had paid $20 to $50 dollars for them, I would expect they might have a short life and be relatively disposable. But this is supposedly a high end product. I have decided to try a different brand.

There is also an outlet and attachment for wired options. I’ve connected to all my Mac devices and to Roku without a hitch.

RYC4GD4O3OYOK,B082GWTZNW,4.0 out of 5 stars Live is very accurate for this line of headphones.,Sam,4,"These headphone feel great, built well, easy to control and sound very different but amazing. I listen to a lot of music and play instruments through these (v-drums, edrums, electronic drums, guitar, etc) and they almost beat out my $400 Bose. I think they do as far as the quality of sound and the feel. When playing or listening it feels like you are at a concert venue or like I'm playing an acoustic drum set. It gives me a lot more options because each change I make to each cymbal or drum head gives it a fuller bodied sound and a uniqueness that other headphones haven't been able to capture from the $20-$600 range. It had a nice amount of bass as well, however, I have to turn it down a little because I worry it will burst the headphones. Over all if you like the sound and feel of live music and play instruments and you are looking for an affordable pair or NC/ANC headphones then these are a great start. Also, other newer, NC/ANC brands like the SONY and Beats have a HORRID lag and these JBL LIVE headphones have ZERO LAG. I have about 4 pairs I like to go between and these have been added to part of the collection.

My feedback for Amazon is to do what you actually say you do and fully inspect the product for quality. There’s no way these headphones were tested for quality by professionals before sending out. The headphones I received are definitely broken. I was hesitant to do so, but I am going to wait for my replacement and see how these behave.

R1NCP4M6N8QH1U,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is unmatched BUT the build quality is poor,Jonathan Hjelm,5,"I purchased these Aonic 50s two years ago and love wearing them for listening to music and taking calls. However, the ear pads and headband material have separated, so I have had to replace them. Considering these headphones' price point, I expected a better build quality. The headphones are relatively heavy and don't fold for travel, so they spend their time at home in the office. The battery life is good, but the audio quality sets these headphones apart from my beats.My report card based on 2 years of use:1) Battery life - B (not the best in the market, not the worst)2) Build quality - B (having to replace the earpads and head pad not due to wear seems like poor quality control). Note that these headphones are heavy and fit kind of loosely. These are not headphones to wear for commuting or being active, as they will fly off your head.3) Call quality - A. Calls are crisp, and mic pick-up is excellent.4) Bluetooth - A. Very good and stable connection even when moving around the house.5) Noise Cancellation - A. This is adjustable in the app and does a quality job of canceling out most background noise.6) Audio Quality - A. Outstanding clarity, especially in the highs and mids. The bass is solid but not overwhelming or muddy. These are my go-to headphones for listening to jazz and classical. The app has EQ controls.7) Value—B. Given some of the poor quality control issues, I am not sure I'd buy these again. However, these headphones sound great. If the build quality were better, they would be outstanding value.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AG2SQLWUOSMKBKKFIJCVW5ZLHL2Q,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1
RSMB9JIRR4RHN,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing LDAC performance and narrow ANC can't keep me from loving these.,R. Barry,5,"These headphones seem to suffer from static and distortion when connected via LDAC. Their ANC seems to be tuned to only focus on a very narrow band of sound, which will probably be great when plane travel and subway cars are regular parts of life again, but mean that the ANC does essentially nothing for the kinds of sounds you deal with when working from home. And, let's be honest, the 20 hours of battery life is on the optimistic side of possible if you're listening via Bluetooth and have ANC or passthrough activated.And yet!These sound so good, and they do so many other things right that other headphones do wrong, that I can't not love them.For reference, the ""name"" headphones I've owned and used in the past are the MDR-7506, ATH-M40x, ATH-ANC9, WH-1000xm2, WI-1000xm2, Razer USB-C ANC, Libratone Q-Adapt In-Ear ANC, and (briefly) NuraLoop—and I wouldn't trade these for any of them.First, the sound: Over the course of an average week, I listen to jazz, jam bands, a few different genres of synth pop, indie rock, film scores, blues, and rock. I prefer a relatively ""flat"" balance, something that will let me hear more complex instrumentation clearly but not make simpler arrangements feel hollow. A week or two into the Aonic 50, I'm consistently discovering new details, even in albums I've listened to dozens and dozens of times before, and even when I'm not sitting down and focusing on the music. Yesterday, while listening to music at work, a song I've listened to hundreds of times over the past 15 years came on. When the chorus kicked in, someone down the hall started singing something loudly enough that I could hear it through my headphones—then I took them off and realized that no one was singing. It was just the Aonic 50 making backup singers audible who were buried so deep in the mix that other headphones had always obscured them before. They are the best sounding Bluetooth over-ears I've ever used, and the best-sounding ANC over-ears I've ever used.Comfort: Yes, the inside of the pads touch my ears. Yes, that usually bothers me a lot and limits how long I can wear a set of headphones for. No, that's not a problem with these. Maybe it's because the interior of the pads are a breathable mesh instead of pleather? Maybe it's because of the cushioning material inside of the earcups? As well as being the best-sounding over-ears, these are the second most comfortable over-ears I've used (after the old ATH-ANC9). And in-ears are just not that comfortable for me. Even with Comply tips. Even with custom tips. So, yeah, I'm finding myself wearing these more often and for longer than any other set of headphones or in-ears I've ever had, and not getting uncomfortable, hot or weary of them. They seem heavy when you're looking at specs, but the difference between these and the WH-1000xm2s is negligible when you're actually wearing them.Wired Connectivity: Dear goodness, other headset makers should be ashamed. SBC, AAC, AptX, AptX-HD, AptX-LL, and LDAC, with pretty easy multi-point connections. With headphone jacks basically extinct except on audiophile-focused devices like PMPs and phones from Sony and LG, and with a lot of Android phone makers choosing either AptX-HD or LDAC instead of supporting both, finding a set of great-sounding headphones that I know I'll be able to still use to their full potential even if I change phones has been much harder than it should be. Huge kudos to Shure for putting in the little bit of extra effort to make sure we aren't dropping hundreds of dollars on something that might end up being crippled if an accident happens and we need to upgrade to a more recent-model phone.Unfortunately, when I connect via LDAC, I get intermittent clicks of static, as well as regular staticy distortion on a lot of midrange and high-end sounds. Not that noticeable when listening to something with crunchy, distorted electric guitar, but pretty glaring on basically all other music and any podcasts or videos. This problem is less noticeable at the lowest of the three LDAC connection speeds, but still present. From looking around at a couple forums, this doesn't seem to be an isolated incident. So, points for LDAC, but deductions for LDAC being inherently problematic. I hope that this is something that can be fixed via a firmware update, because it's the thing that's really keeping me from being able to recommend these without reservation.Wired Connectivity: Again, the Aonic 50 makes other headphones look deliberately crippled. Bluetooth headphones, especially ones that cost between $200 and $500, are targeted at people who use them on the go—and if the headphones have ANC, it's probably because those on-the-go folks are often dealing with train and plane engine noise. USB-C quick-charging is great, but so many headphones don't let you listen while charging, and despite the fact that USB-C is perfectly capable of delivering data and power at the same time, most headphones don't let you listen over USB-C. These do. It's not a feature I'd probably use A LOT, but it's a feature that I know I'm going to be REALLY glad for on the few occasions I do need it. It's a little gesture that engenders a ton of goodwill from me.The other wired listening option is via a 2.5mm analogue jack. The headphones come with a 2.5mm-to-3.5mm cable, and I already have a third-party 2.5mm-to-3.5mm cable that includes inline volume controls, mic and remote, but a more standard 3.5mm jack on the headphones would have taken it from good to great.Basically, these are great, but their LDAC implementation is sub-par.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2020",AH7DQIDDXHVRIHV6TAIAH37OD74Q,TRUE,32,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1

The Shure Aonic 50 sound signature is very scooped in the mids, the bass is pulled back compared to most, and there's some odd brightness that sometimes is nice but often has been irritating or harsh depending on the album. And at first they sounded very muddy in the low end. It took me a while to get decent sound out of them. Here's what I did to get decent sound out of them. First of all, I wasn't able to EQ up the bass too much, it doesn't stand up well to more than a few dB. In the Shure PLAY app, I EQed the bass shelf up at 50 Hz by just +3.0 dB with a gradual slope of 1.9 oct. That seems to be the best I can do for balancing the weak bass without making everything muddy. Most importantly, the bass sounded weak at first due to what I assume to be a bad fit. After a day of use, the pads adjusted and they did fit better and sound tighter in the low end. The other thing that needed fixing was the scooped mids. I added a wide parametric EQ boost of +3.5 dB at 460 Hz, with a width of 1.7 oct. They could use more in the mids, honestly, but I'm trying to not push my luck and risk going too far. Lastly, they have a boosted sharpness from 4000 to 5000 Hz, so I had EQ that down with a -1.5 dB dip at 4500 Hz with a narrow bandwidth of 1.5 oct. Those three EQ adjustments have made them really well rounded. There are a few strange resonance issues in the highs (e.g. a track I heard with whistling suddenly got really sharp and irritating) but overall pretty good.Surprisingly, turning the ANC on and off doesn't change the sound much at all, if you're in a quiet room. So, that's really niceCOMFORT. These headphones are small, hot, tight, and ill-fitting on my XL head. My old cheaper Austrian Audio Hi-X25bt headphones are FAR more comfortable than the Shures. The Shures don't extend far enough; they barely fit over my head when extended all the way. The cups are small; my ears don't fit inside the cups. My ears are touching the ear pads all around top bottom and back. Seriously, I feel like these headphones are crumpling my ears up in to little balls. And they're hot and sweaty feeling, too. I've worn them for 30 minutes just now, and my ears already feel hot. The Austrian Audio Hi-X25bt, by comparison, are light and cool and have lots of room inside. My wife has the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones, which in comparison have similarly small ear cups etc, similar to the Shures, though the Shures are heavier feeling and have a much stronger clamp force. When I try the Sennheisers, they also don't fit around my ears, but it doesn't seem as uncomfortable because they are light and sit happily on top of my ears. I can't stress enough how horrible the Shure Aonic 50 gen 2 fit is for folks with big ears. It's badThe Shures look and feel more modern and fashionable etc, compared to the Austrian Audio. I think they feel sturdier than the Sennheiser Momentum 4s as well, but then Sennheiser has a reputation for making lightweight headphones that last forever despite feeling ""plasticky."" These Shures are not plasticky, they are really sturdy. The cups are plastic but that's probably useful for acoustics and keeping the weight down.If you have small ears, strong air conditioning, and you like a bright scooped sound, these headphones are for you. And their features and the app etc are really well implemented. They just don't compare well to my older much cheaper bt headphones from Austrian Audio, and that means I regret purchasing them.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2023",AGC5HC223XL2PGL25EI4GZP3GCRA,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 2
R2C7HR56AIQ848,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable Great sounding noise canceler.,Jeff Casperson,5,"Some brands are known for certain things. In audio, Shure is known for iconic microphones and iems. AS well as headphones to a lesser extent. This headphone, the Aonic 50; is their first Bluetooth overear headphone with active noise canceling.The box is unique in that it is mostly round, the case is big, but is well built and has room for cables, and a DAP if you want to use the headphones with something other than your smartphone. AS far as cables go, shure includes a good length USB-C cable, as well as an analog cable with a 2.5 MM plug for the headphones, and a 3.5 MM plug for the end that connects to your phone, laptop etc. If you own a headphone that doesn't have a headphone jack and you want to stream wired, the Aonic 50 can also be used for listening via USB-C. It can charge while being used for audio via USB-C as well.The headphones took 4 hours to charge, and you get 23 hours while using ANC. Will be longer battery life in passive mode, but volume level of course will affect how long they last before needing a charge.For bluetooth they support SBC, AAC, APTX, APTX-LL, APTX-HD and LDAC. APTX-LL helps reduce or illiminate the lag of audio while watching video, but only on compatible devices from brands such as LG, Google and Samsung.The headphones also have a companion app, the shure play app found in the play store and app store.Through the app you can adjust noise canceling and transparent hearing levels, e.G. by default the ANC mode is set at maximum, but in the app you can change the default to the lower setting if you want, and it's easy to switch between the 2. That default you choose is saved to the headphones as well. Through the same app you can create playlists with your existing music files stored on your device or SD card, as well as use various sound presets or create your own custom sound. Sadly, shure made the curious decision of only allowing the sound to be changed while playing music in the app. Several people have asked if this will be changed in a future update, which will be helpful if you want to change the sound but stream music through a service like Amazon music HD, Spotify etc. Fortunately the headphones really do sound fantastic out of the box however.These are objectively, the most neutral bluetooth headphones i've ever listened to. While i haven't listened to every bluetooth headphone out there, i've owned or auditioned many of the top models from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, B & W, PSB, NAD, Beyerdynamic AudioTechnica etc. neutral means different things to different people, and that isn't a bad thing, but in each varrying opinion of neutral there is some level of balance relative to what you hear, and the amount of it. E.G. how much bass you might hear, proportionate to the mids and treble.In the case of the Aonic 50, the mids are smooth but precise, occasionally that precision does reveal slight spikes in upper mids and treble, but this doesn't happen often and is the exception. more often however, you get a clinical representation of your music, which takes the experience of listening to these headphones to a special place.AT times i wish that bass drums had just a bit more fullness to them, but they certainly don't sound thin. Bass is present when called upon, and you always hear and feel the lowest notes in a way that is impressive.listening via the analog cable even while hooked up to a pocket HD radio is amazing.Noise canceling blocks out low rumbles well and some mid sounds but voices come through but at a level that isn't a distraction. And with music on you'd be hard pressed to hear much of anything going on around you.Shure also provides the option to listen to what i around you, via what they refer to as 'Environment mode.' This setting is very natural sounding on the headphones and while it can be adjusted, is at a perfect level for my use.The buttons are on the right earcup, as well as the charing and analog ports.The power button is on the bottom, and powers the headphones after being held for 2 seconds. By default the Aonic 50 is in pairing mode, but if you need to connect to a 2nd device to take advantage of the multipoint connectivity shure has included, then press and hold the power button for 6 seconds till you hear pairing mode. 2 quick taps of the power button gives an estimate of the battery level at high, medium and low.the next button is the volume down, the volume up is 2 buttons above it. inbetween these 2 is a small but distinct multifunction button. pressing and holding for 2 seconds while listening to audio or when music is paused activates your assistent. 1 press for play-pause, 2 for next track, 3 for previous track. For calls 1 press to answer and end, a press and hold for 2 seconds rejects the call. people i spoke with said that i sounded clear, even while doing tasks around the house or walking around. The last button is set in the middle by default, which is pasive mode. one flick down activates ANC and 1 flick up from default position activates environement mode.shure really hit it out of the park with this headphone. This was a well thought out, comfortable, well designed stylish headphone that tries to do everything and does it well.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2020",AEJE3YYJADW4FF6VI4SVPAG3SIQQ,TRUE,23,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1
R3SXEO3CCYM5CA,B084S1CYKF,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, premium look and feel, but not the best cans for my use case",Daniel Olops,3,"I really wanted to like these headphones. They're beautiful and have a premium look and feel. But when compared to the Sony WH-1000XM4 or the Bose NC 700, it's not a match for the things I care about the most. For context, these are the top 3 I need to cover, in order of priority:* Noise cancellation (passive and active combined), so I can focus while I work from home with two small children. It's also useful when playing on stage, so I can hear myself.* Call quality, both in terms of voice clarity and noise cancellation (NOTE: boomless headphones like these 3 will generally have a ""OK"" or less mic quality. If you want a high quality mic, you'll probably want to stick to headphones with a boom mic).* Comfort, so I can wear headphones for extended hours (NOTE: close-back headphones like these ones aren't as comfortable as open-back ones, therefore some discomfort after a few hours is expected).Apart from that, I'm also looking for:* Versatility, so I can use it with my work laptop (Mac), my phone (Pixel 5), and my keyboard (Roland FA-06).* Audio quality, with a balanced spectrum.* Nice features and a nice app. As for voice assistance support, I don't really mind.Based on that, what I observed was:* Noise cancellation: it's not bad, however it's definitely not on the same league as the other two. Sony's and Bose's are superior, with Sony's winning by some small margin.* Call quality: neither Shure's nor Sony's can possibly compete with the Bose's. For a boomless mic, it works great: voice sounds clear to the other parties, and noise is mostly cancelled. Check videos on YouTube on that.* Comfort: Shure's don't seem to be well suited for people with big heads wearing glasses. Both the clamping force and the headband are a bit tight, and the earcups don't fit well enough, pressing the bottom of m ears. On top of that, Shure's is heavier. For me, the Bose's are the most comfortable, with Sony's doing a decent job as well.* Versatility: I could use it fine with the laptop and the phone, both connected at the same time. However, when using it with the keyboard, I noticed some hum noise when Noise Cancelling was on. That didn't happen with neither Sony's nor Bose's.* Audio quality: I liked Shure's the most. Airy, balanced, rather weak on basses but sounding beautifully. I could hear tracks I hadn't heard with cheaper headphones. I still haven't made my mind on how do the other two compare.* Features & app: feature-wise, it lacks Voice Assistance support (meh), but it offers plenty of codecs, and high-quality audio over USB-C (no mic). Sony's don't offer aptX, and Bose's only support AAC.* App: Shure's one is pretty spartan, and EQ only works when songs are played through the app. The best one so far seems to be Sony's, with plenty of features and reliable connection. Bose's one sometimes cannot connect to the headphones for no apparent reason, and doesn't have as many features as Sony's.While testing it, I had connectivity issues after leaving the room while wearing the headphones, in which case it lost connection to both laptop and phone. Sometimes, when I came back, it won't connect to the laptop at all. Only solution found was to reset paired device list, and pair it again. It happened twice on the same day. I contacted Shure's support, which came back within the deadline and provided a decent answer, as far as support in general goes. They didn't have an immediate clue, though, and offered a replacement. I won't pursue that, given the other findings above. For the record, I also had connectivity issues with both Bose's and Sony's when leaving the room like that, therefore I just stopped doing that.Overall, Shure's one had the most premium look and fell, the best sound IMO, and the most codecs. But since the others performed better at the key aspects I care about, I'm afraid this one's a no-go.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2021",AF2WFDHHBXNRI4I4UVUIJBO6G6HQ,TRUE,11,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1
R1BUD151T7UPI0,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Perhaps the Best Workhorse Over-Ear Currently Available (For Me),Mason Dixon,5,"The astonishingly difficult search for a jack-of-all-trades set of over-ear Bluetooth headphones inspired me to offer my insights on the AONIC 50s should they assist anyone else on a similar journey. Here's a couple qualifiers upfront: the 5 star rating is within the context of what's presently on the market in the sub $500 range (judged on their own merits, a few tolerable quirks probably make them a 4), and I had some wishlist items that may not apply to everyone. The contenders I finally settled on were: these Shure AONIC50s, the B&O HX, and the B&W Px7 series 2. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 had just come out, and because they were $50 more with a regrettably plasticy looking build I felt the others had more to offer. The Audio-Technica ATHM-50xBT is also capable but I've never enjoyed their fit and finish. They're bulky, and while they feel solid, they also somehow feel cheap. Some of the Sony models arguably might've deserved more thought, but much of what sets them apart from others in the same class is their ANC and that feature was way at the bottom of my wishlist. So while I focused on the pluses and minuses of three models the list certainly could've been longer. (There's also comments here that relate to some Beats Studio3s that I currently own, but they wouldn't be in the running anyway.)The ideal feature list was for an all-arounder pair of over-ear Bluetooth headphones that could perform a few specific functions I commonly require in an Apple-centric home office and casual music listening scenario. I was looking for something 1) With good sound (obviously). 2) Had Bluetooth for convenience, but also a wired option that DOESN'T require the headphones to be powered. This turned out to be a somewhat unique feature that cut against B&O and B&W offerings. 3) ANC wasn't a huge priority. I'm generally not a fan, but do appreciate the capability for potential commuting situations. 4) Physical buttons. I just prefer them and have found most touch/gesture interfaces to be confusing or overly sensitive. 5) Reasonably comfortable for extended wear. 6) Enough battery to get me though all-day recording sessions over Zoom. 7) At least some attempt at design. You'd be right to point out that's a dumb qualifier for headphones, but I have to look at them all the time sitting around me desk. Related to that; they'd see most of their time indoors so folding/portability wasn't a huge factor.Additional additional sweeteners, but not essential, were: 1) A decent onboard mic. Although I primarily use other audio inputs with my desktop it's always nice to have a reliable remote option. 2) A standard 3.5mm wired connection. But everyone seems to use a 2.5mm to 3.5mm if the option is even available. And, 3) a replaceable battery. This basically doesn't exist anywhere, so forget that. I think there was a single B&O model a few years back and there isn't much interest in addressing that issue across the industry.Asking any headphones to do so many things is a tall order and I entered into all this with the assumption there would be tradeoffs. And there are. Yet the AONIC 50s tick more boxes for me than I probably had the right to expect.SOUND: Pretty darn good - maybe even amazing considering the price point and feature set. They sound great over BT (where I'm locked into ACC via Apple and bound by the technical limitations affecting literally all headphones - ""HD"" simply isn't possible over BT). They sound even better powered off running through my desktop amp squeezing more juice out of higher resolution digital files. Should I have a separate pair of non-Bluetooth open-back headphones for that type of listening? Probably. But the Shures at least make me feel like I don't HAVE to. And it's nice to have something that can competently handle switching between different tasks without adding more clutter to my studio space. It should be noted they need to be 'off' to get the most out of wired listening and you'll lose ANC and 'passthrough audio' function when doing so. Not a problem for me. They'll still work 'on' over 3.5mm or USB-C (which can charge while listening), but the resolution ceiling of BT kicks in (or something along those lines, there's an identifiable difference in any case).My AONIC 50s are only ever presented with digital music, - usually with some 3rd party EQ (eqMac on the desktop and 'Equalizer' by Audioforge Labs on the iPhone). When adding those I did have some trouble dialing them in at the beginning, however that may be unique to my setup and possibly some user error on my part. They didn't appear to take EQ well and got a little sloppy in the bass and/or shrill in the upper mids on some tracks. One reason for this was when they first arrived and I fiddled around with the accompanying ShurePlay app I turned on the their equalizer, which saves last used settings to the headphones. But I normally use those other two, so there was a double-EQ thing going on. Additionally, my prior listening setup involved switching off between a pair of B&O H4s and Beats Studio3s - both of which required more EQ fiddling to get what I wanted. With those as my benchmark I think I tried to put the AONIC 50s in what I assumed was ""my"" curve rather than making an effort to tune them on their own. The Shures preferred far subtler frequency adjustments and I find myself bouncing between their out-of-the-box tuning and something with a slight bump below 250Hz and above 10,000Hz (wasn't expecting that last one but it's probably more about adding some perceived clarity to hearing suffering the abuse of old age and too many loud concerts). Once that got sorted out they came alive. The lesson being I found them to respond much better to smaller EQ adjustments than I was accustomed to. In fact the AONIC 50s don't seem to appreciate being muscled out of their curve with big swings. That's not to say you don't have much control over their sound, it's very much the opposite. Small frequency changes could have a noticeable impact. I only mention this because if you typically use an equalizer and don't like the sound you're getting from these, try setting the frequencies at a fraction of what you normally would and see if that gets you closer to where you want to be.At the start of my headphone search I kinda assumed I'd end up with B&O HXs. The B&O's are generally the most comfortable around and their house sound has a nice warmth, but they color the sound no matter what you do on the EQ front. Despite the difficulties that occasionally causes for my work I they're enjoyable to listen to, and I probably wouldn't have expanded my search if not for my experience with the H4s. Once B&O comes out with a new model they're done with you. You'll never get another firmware update, they burry trouble shooting info, they may not even service them anymore. It's over. My max battery life on those is now 80% so they have an expiration date. That made the added expense of the B&O's a little less appealing. Coming to terms with the realization that all Bluetooth headphones have a built in service life far shorter than their traditional counterparts has certainly put a ceiling on what I'm willing to pay. Once it starts inching up to $400 it becomes a big part of my thinking. At $500 I'm in ""hard pass"" territory. And the only reason I'm even willing to consider anything in that range is because I use headphones so often and care enough about audio quality to consider that money well spent. Nevertheless, it'll be a sad day when look down at my dead, semi-expensive headphones that would be perfectly fine if not for a trashed un-replaceable battery, or firmware update that will never come.As for B&W, I keep trying to like them but never get there. I have some Bowers & Wilkins speakers that I love, yet the headphones never quite do it for me sound-wise. And the ever contentious Beats? They're okay. Judged purely objectively in terms of sound vs. price/value, however, it's hard not to see them as a terrible choice. After stubbornly refusing to evolve for over a decade they've finally started to waver somewhat on their $350 price tag, sometimes appearing as low as $180. The problem is they only start to become appealing around $150 imo, and that's ONLY for the genuine added convenience they offer in an Apple ecosystem. Even at discounted rates you can find something sounding vastly superior.CONNECTIVITY: Bluetooth for the most part functions well with decent range. No latency issues of any kind. Occasionally I'll have a single split-second hiccup - just once and not frequently. But I'm not willing to ascribe this to the AONIC 50s just yet. I have a suspicion it may be Apple related for both the desktop and iOS instances where it occurs. Bluetooth specifically (and audio more broadly) have been a little wonky for me since the release of Big Sur and whatever iOS corresponded with that.In a dream world these would've had a 3.5mm jack on the headphones, but pretty much everyone that has a wired connection option is at 2.5mm. This isn't a problem in and of itself, only when you want to find a cable. Adapters suck and there aren't many 2.5mm to 3.5mm cables out there. I was a little shocked to find these were the only headphones on my search list to work while connected via audio cable AND powered off. I'm assuming the others' rationale for that is that it gives you access to the onboard DAC and ANC capabilities. Since I'd rather be able to use my headphones if the battery is completely drained I consider this a fairly significant feature (one I could've easily overlooked with its competitors if I weren't actively looking for that information).The AONIC 50s do contain multi-point connectivity, I'm just not sure how I feel about it yet. There's times where having my desktop and iPhone attached to the Shures simultaneously is great, and times where it's a nuisance. Although you can always just manually disconnect either source (note: if multiple-point is enabled in the app both sources will automatically reconnect next time you power up). On the whole it's probably a net positive. But there's times where it causes things like the Music app to open unintentionally, and I suspect it may prevent the headphones from going into stand-by mode when something is 'active' on one of the devices. There've been times I was shocked to see the remaining battery percentage and I think this might be the culprit.ANC: I don't use this feature much, but it seems good to me. You can set either 'ANC' or 'Environmental Mode' (essentially a pass-through function allowing you to hear more outside nose using the microphones) with a physical switch on the right ear cup. It's nice to have access to that change via button and not through an app or menu setting. Adjustments to levels foreach ARE made within the ShurePlay app however. I kinda like this arrangement - particularly after dealing with the Beats Studio3 where they would automatically default to ANC for every use (seriously, there's no way to save the setting 'ANC Off' on Beats, and no way to change strength levels when it's on - it's crazy).CONTROLS: As I mentioned before; I prefer buttons. Touch-controls are great in theory. And I was willing to tolerate them without too much fuss should I have ended up up with the B&O HX, but I greatly appreciate having landed on something with good ol' fashioned buttons. They're fast becoming extinct, my friends (although I believe the B&W Px7 has them as well). That beings said, it's one of the few areas where the AONIC 50 could improve. Although fairly easy to operate once you locate the little center button they aren't particularly tactile. After four months I still hunt a little sometimes. They're also the only thing that stands out as feeling a little cheap to me. Not that they seem like they're going to break easily or anything, they just feel 'cheap.' It would've been nice to have something more substantial - maybe raised with some rubbery texture.COMFORT/BUILD: Overall they feel robust. They're a significant step up from Beats and only a slight step down from B&O and Bowers & Wilkins. If you put 'em all in a pile the AONIC 50s look like a relative bargain in terms of build quality. The flimsy Beats appear criminally overpriced and the small (but authentic) material upgrades on the B&O and B&W make you wonder if they deserve to charge $200-$300 more. The Shures sit right in the sweet spot - you get some metal and added material in places they didn't necessarily need to add it, and plastic instead of leather and metal where it might be if these were slightly more 'premium.'They don't fold down for storage however, which could be an issue for those seeking slightly more portability. But for use predominantly in the home I think it's a plus. The clamping pressure is good on my average sized head, and I don't experience any hot-spots/discomfort with the well-padded band. My right ear does ever so slightly touch the interior, which can be irritating well into extended listening sessions. I've been meaning to replace the earpads with Dekonis to both circumvent the issues some have reported with seam separation on the stock pads and to achieve some additional depth. I purchased my AONIC 50s on sale so the additional $60-70 expense sits okay with me. Not sure if I'd feel the same if I paid the full $300 though. I'll try and report back after I install those regarding any improvements or differences. Or if I start to see any separation on the band as also reported.EARPAD UPDATE: I do go ahead and purchase Dekoni 'Choice Leather' earpads. They're a mixed bag. Sound-wise they don't do anything to mess with the pleasant voice of the AONIC 50s. If anything there might be a slight improvement. Perhaps even a little added spaciousness in the higher end resulting from the literal added space of deeper cups and solid pleather material on the interior (as opposed to the hybrid design of the stock version). Some have described the foam of the Dekonis as firmer, but softness feels comparable to me (it may be slightly denser however). The added depth did solve the problem of my ear rubbing against the inside, so they're a definite comfort improvement for me. Although if you don't need the extra space you can probably feel okay about putting these off until if/when you encounter the reported issues with the stock ear cups. They also appear to suffer from the same design flaw of the originals. I do recommend them overall, but at around $60 they may only be worth it if they're solving one of those problems. I attached some photos featuring the physical differences between the two.BATTERY LIFE: As some have mentioned, my headphones arrived with a completely dead battery. That is indeed notable, and I opted to fully charge them before attempting any kind of use (set up, demo, etc.). I don't always feel as though I'm getting and accurate reading of levels in the moment, but in the aggregate it seems correct. That is to say it may read higher than it probably should, or drop a few percent in one chunk. It's as if the battery info isn't delivered on an ongoing basis but rather reassessed and tabulated from time to time. Nothing major, just something I noticed. In terms of battery life these have less capacity compared to others, yet offer more than enough to make it though 8AM-6PM recording sessions. But not 2 days of that in a row, so I have to pay special attention to charging in those situations. As such I might quibble with the stated ""20hrs"" of battery life. Although... oddly, I feel as though battery life has improved somewhat since I first got these. This is completely anecdotal however, and I'm not sure if that's a function of me just getting used to them or if some kind of battery ""learning"" is occurring in the background and making adjustments. I'll try to study that more empirically.Final conclusion is these are a solid pick as all-arounder Bluetooth headphones - particularly in a home-based environment where you need something that can wear a few different hats. At the current MSRP of $300 I still stand by that assessment, although they start to compete with other choices at that point. These will still be one of the cheaper options, but you may decide something else is worth the additional $100-$150 for a particular feature or finish. Even then, if you're looking for something in BT that can also handle occasional quasi-uncolored monitoring these may be more desirable regardless. It's really just the AONIC 50s and the Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT (with the edge going to the Shures on a few fronts) until you get into the $600+ range with the Beyerdynamic Amiron and Focal whatever. When these go on sale it gets especially difficult to think of anything that can beat 'em.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2023",AHWDDI2H76SJJA7FOEPFKDBIUGEQ,TRUE,22,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1

Ok, so I'm not an audiophile, i use headphones for WFH, meetings, listening to music and video tutorials. I've had them for more than a week now, while having them on for a couple of hours during the day.CONS:1. When I got them out of the box, the chemical smell got me blown away, it was soooo bad. It took at least 3 days until i could not feel the smell when they are on top of my head, but still can smell it when they hang around my neck. Now, after more than a week, can't feel the smell if they just dangle on my neck, but feel it if they get closer to my neck.2. The size of the headband is not so big, i have a medium to larger head, definitely nothing out of the ordinary, and i wish they could have extended a little more, because they apply pressure on top of my head. It got better after a couple of days, but the first days, the top of my head would begin to hurt after 20 minutes.3. The reason I actually gonna return them, could have lived with the previous stuff, is after a couple of days, the right side is making a lot of crackling noise when you move it, either up and down, or rotate it. For example, when you move your head, or talk, you will hear the noise right in your ear.4. I was not impressed with the noice cancelling. Don't have a lot to compare to, but listening to the Bose's and Sony's top of the line couple of years ago (35 II, 1000xm3) and especially the sony blocked the noise a lot better.PROS:Sound quality is really good. Other people hear me well during a phone call. Decent battery life. Lots of bluetooth codes. Nice buttons for controls, not a big fan of touch based controls. Ability to connect to 2 devices at the same time.

Not the typical bass-heavy tuning present in most wireless headphones.The bad:* While the overall frame feels very well built, with metal yokes and hinges, the headband padding feels thin and delicate, and is apparently prone to ripping along the top edge.* For larger heads at least, these are extremely uncomfortable. At full extension, which is the still about an inch shorter than most headphones, clamp force is the strongest I've experienced in a wireless headphone. This is made worse by the excessively stiff swivel joints that effectively guarantee that clamp force is unevenly distributed around your ears. The padding on the earcups also doesn't help, as it is both thin and rigid, with less space for your ears than most headphones.* The ANC is just terrible, even compared to much cheaper headphones. In addition to simply not blocking noise effectively in general, it has a very hard time doing anything about wind noise especially when blowing toward the rear vent holes. It also produces a faint clicking noise in the right earcup every half second for as long as it is enabled. Ambient mode works decently for awareness, but not so much for conversation.* The ""spacializer"" seems to be essentially just a glorified EQ.","Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2023",AFYKNIPJAGVIV526G7EVQVLDIRCA,TRUE,3,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 2
R24F856V0W9MTU,B084S1CYKF,"5.0 out of 5 stars Not for big heads, but very nice if you tweak the sound",Tom W.,5,"If you have a large head these do not extend far enough to fit your ears into the ear cups. Also the clamping force is more than it needs to be. Users complaining about them being too big must be tiny people. I'm 6'4"" for reference (most people are tiny to me). They just nearly almost fit if I pull them as far as I can, tilt them forward to an awkward angle and push the padding down as far as it will go. While they are probably comfortable headphones for most people, this makes them a little bit uncomfortable for me.The headphones came with zero charge, which is different from any lithium ion device I've ever purchased, and makes me wonder about the battery. I did finally get it charged and the percentage indicator is going down slowly enough that I'm not worried about it now at this point. If that changes I'll do another update.They are very attractive headphones, but a bit small. My hat size is 7 7/8 for reference, which is ""Extra Extra Large"". If you have a normal adult or even XL head these will fit you fine. If you are a small child you should look elsewhere.The ""Environment Mode"" is absolutely sweet. This feature is much better than the Bose QC45's ""aware mode"". It actually amplifies sounds around you so that you hear more clearly even than with open-back headphones. And you can adjust the volume level. And most surprisingly of all, it does not affect the sound quality or level at all. This might just be the reason I keep these headphones even if they are a bit small.The sound is... well it's different. Out of the box with the high quality codec (LDAC) on my Android 11 Lenovo tablet it is very detailed, but very flat. Thankfully there is an option to turn that off, since you can't do EQ with LDAC codec. If you update the firmware (I'm at 7.5.0 now) you can set the EQ. In order to get anywhere near that lush low-end that Bose has (and it's no longer the default on the QC45, you have to adjust those too) you have to EQ the heck out of these things. Basically I'm maxing out everything under 125hz or so. I have the low shelf set to 100hz, gain 10dB (max) and BW 1.6 octaves. Band 2 is at 125hz, 7.5dB gain and 0.9 octave. This gets close to that lovely bass sound on the Bose QCs with bass boost enabled. And yes, it sounds fine, they handle the full amplification without distorting.But here's the thing. Even though it's a pain to get that lovely bone-thumping bass going, these sound much, much better than my QC45s. I left the rest of the EQ flat on the Aonics and oh my... I hear things I have never heard before. I was looking for something with better sound and I just might have found it.These seem to be designed as bluetooth studio monitors. Leave the HQ codec on and these have that characteristic flat but super-detailed sound that really good studio monitors have. With a cable I assume it would be similar.As far as noise cancelling you can't use the EQ while ""max NC"" is on. The app switches to ""normal NC"", which seems pretty good. I can snap my fingers right next to my ear and barely hear it at all, so it's a win for me. If I need to use them on a flight I might consider removing EQ and maxing out the noise cancellation, but I use them at work where I'd prefer to hear somebody talking to me. Which is why I like the environment mode so well. But switching back and forth is super easy, you just slide the switch up for environmental, middle for normal and down for noise cancelling. I think it's even easier to use than the QC45 button press.Update: I really, really wanted to like these. But they're just too small to be comfortable. I'm returning them. I really wish there was some option other than Bose Quiet Comfort, but they are king for a reason it seems.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2022",AGDJWWS3BMRWR2NAZTD7RRYYAXIA,TRUE,11,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1

R2EVSSB14SH02U,B084S1CYKF,4.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Headphones with Sub-Par Noise Cancelling,J DeGarmo,4,"I bought the Sony WH-1000XM3, Sennheiser Momentum 3, and these Shure headphones to compare and will return 2 of them. By far, the Shure AONIC 50 headphones sound the best (except for noise cancelling). I've been working from home while testing these out and there's a 2 year old running around, so the environment is not quiet. I'm judging the sound quality over all over aspects. Listened to Tidal Hi-Fi and Spotify wirelessly on my iPhone.Sorry, this ended up being longer than I expected.Sony WH-1000XM3:- Bass thumps nicely, you feel it in your body but it's a little unbalanced (Not everyone will want this much bass, but you can use the EQ in the app to reduce it to a tasteful amount)- BEST noise cancelling (I was surprised how well the noise cancelling worked, best I've ever heard and there are a few customizable options in the app)- Overall sound quality is good/great depending on the song.- Comfortable for short uses, but least comfortable in the group. After a full workday, the band on top made my head hurt and I had a mild headache.- Having the touch controls on the outside of the right earpiece is a fun feature. After an hour or so, I got the hang of it.- Earpieces fold up into the headband and can twist to lay flat. Firm case for storage will protect them well and is compact for traveling.- Third PlaceSennheiser Momentum 3 (~$60 more than the Sonys):- More balanced sound quality that I preferred over the Sonys, but there's less distinction between instruments. Occasionally, some songs sounded muddier than I preferred but overall it sounded great. The EQ in the app sucks though.- Noise cancelling was fine, did not come close to how well the Sony worked.- More comfortable than the Sonys. Didn't have a headache at the end of the day and I had to reposition the band on top fewer times.- No touch controls, there's physical buttons along the rim of the right earpiece. Easy to use.- Earpieces fold up into the headband but cannot twist to lay flat.- Feels higher quality than the Sonys and the leather smells fantastic.- A really nice feature is when you take an earpiece off your ear to talk to someone, the music pauses automatically and plays when it goes back on your ear. Even putting the headphones on your head but not on your ear doesn't cause this to misfire. It was perfect.- Case is softer and not rigid, so least amount of protection in the group.- Second PlaceShure AONIC 50 (~$110 more than the Sonys):- Very balanced sound quality with the most detail from the group. I enjoyed listening to these more than the other headphones. In most songs, I can pick out an instrument and follow it throughout the song. Bass-heavy songs or songs with a lot of treble, it doesn't matter, these headphones sound the best. I haven't listened to a song yet where the highs squeal in a way that makes you feel like a knife is being stabbed in your neck, which I did encounter on the other headphones. (I've been listening to my regular music but also various Headphone Test playlists that help you get a feel for all aspects of your headphones. I recommend the What Hi-Fi? playlist on Spotify and Tidal. The song ""You've Got to Have Freedom"" by Pharoah Sanders gave me the neck-stabbing feeling on the other headphones, FYI.) One frustrating thing about the EQ, it can't be used unless you're listening to your personal music stored on your phone. The EQ will not work with Spotify or Tidal. However after a week of use, I wouldn't adjust the EQ anyways so it's not an issue for me.- Noise-cancelling is mediocre. There isn't much of a difference with it on or off. However, having my volume between 50-75% drowned out most noise so it's negligible in my situation. Some reviews from audio websites have said these have great noise cancelling, but that was not my experience. Keep in mind, your milage may very.- Most comfortable in the group. No headache and rarely adjust the band on top, even after a full workday.- Earpieces do not fold up (not good for commuters), but they do twist for a thinner profile. Largest case, but is rigid, so great protection.- Quality feels on-par with the Sennheisers. Both have more metal than the Sonys. Leather is also high quality and smells great.- First PlaceAll 3 headphones are good enough to be bought and will be thoroughly enjoyed, especially considering the price difference. I will keep the Shures because they sound the best to my ear.","Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2020",AHA7SHSC5X5IX7EJMTMCQ2BSEMPA,TRUE,307,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1
R176TMVV48CZ27,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars A life saver for tinnitus/Long Covid,Ken C.,5,"I've been fighting with tinnitus that has been amplified exponentially since getting Covid at the beginning of the year. Many noises that aren't irritating or upsetting to 99% of humanity have suddenly initiated fight/flight instincts with the severity of the tinnitus I'm experiencing. I have been trying to find ways to find a way to survive this and these headphones have done a superb job of this.'I have been using these daily for over two months, for podcasts, for music (MP3/FLAC, and streaming), for what little television I can handle (another covid sensory issue altogether) and just for quieting the outside world's noise. I don't have to blare music at high levels to get the effects of the noise cancelling. In fact there are times i just walk around with them in silence.I've used these indoors, and outdoors. about 90%/10% split.They can usually handle being one floor up from the source of their signal unless interfered by something such as a microwave.They work well being connected to my cellphone for calls, and my computer or television for music/etc. For example if you have both your phone and your computer connected for AUDIO there can be issues where they will step on one another. To prevent this, just have your phone set for calls, and the issue is circumvented. I don't see this as a knock on the headphones, but just how Bluetooth is.The only knock I've had with them outdoors is wind can really cause some pretty heavy noise that is incredibly irritating (to me.)These headphones are not meant for exercise or any type of heavy perspiration. However, they even state this, and I didn't expect otherwise. I will say that if your ears/head can get overheated from them depending on how easily you overheat.They perform spectacularly for the majority of the uses. Are these as good as a set of wired headphones with a headphone amp? No. However they do an admiral job, and the only bad sound I've gotten from them was from low quality <128kb MP3 sources.Could the Noise cancelling be better? Yes. After checking the newer Sony WH-1000XM5, it is not nearly as impressive as those. HOWEVER, the sound of the AONIC50's better to me than the Sonys AND these are ~$150 cheaper.I cannot stress how much these have been a life-changer for me. I was having problems being tied to the computer with my other headphones/headsets. The Shure AONIC 50's have really made my life better and easily been one of my best purchases in the last few years.----------------Pros:- Incredibly good sound, for music, for podcasts, for television, and anything you throw at it.- Comfortable. I can have them on my head for extended periods of time without too much discomfort. (See full review above)Cons:- Noise cancellation still cannot hold a candle to Sony WH-1000XM5. However they cost 2/3rd the price of the Sony's- Not great for outdoors, especially if it's windy out.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2022",AEN3DNSTWGQV5AE4J7V5B7XDEK4A,TRUE,9,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1
R3SORX2LH1FFGJ,B084S1CYKF,"5.0 out of 5 stars The first to get it right including LDAC, Multipoint and best-in-class noise cancellation",A. Cook,5,"I'm looking for it all - headphones that qualify as 'Audiophile', that I can use for everything from listening to high-quality music (without dropping two grand on a pair of cans from which I'm not going to get the full benefit) while being able to spend hours at a time working at my computer on conference calls, listening to music between them, and being able to switch between phone and computer seamlessly.I have tried endless earbuds. The closest I have found so far are the Bose QC30 neck-band earphones with -very good- active noise cancellation. Although good, they are aging and don't support LDAC, APTX, APTX-HD etc. for high quality audio. Other earphones, although good, fall short at least in one or more areas. And in almost all cases, they don't support multipoint fully or correctly, even if they claim they do. Bose and Shure are the only ones that do.The Sony WH-1000XM3s are good, (I have a pair) but in audio quality (supported CoDecs) they fall short, and they do not support multipoint fully.The Shure Aonic 50s are, thus far, the only headphones that meet all my requirements, and I am VERY impressed. I use mainly Dell and HP notebooks, and they connect successfully with both the 'Stereo' (music) and 'Voice' profiles - this is a primary requirement for multipoint to work correctly. On my phone (Samsung Note 10+) they connect also for voice and music (as you would expect) but also, importantly, the LDAC option shows up in the Bluetooth profile, allowing one to enable the LDAC steaming providing up to 990kbps streaming - Yay. (In Developer options you can select APTX and other Codecs manually but not needed for me)Multipoint: This one is not easy. So far I have found that only Bose and Shure have been able to implement it fully and correctly. I can now be simultaneously connected to my computer and phone, and seamlessly switch between the two, no questions asked. This is exactly as designed, but hard to implement correctly in practice. If I'm on a Skype or Zoom call, I can answer a call on my phone, and then get back to my conference cal. I can be streaming from a local server or Spotify on my phone, and interrupt it with a YouTube stream on my computer, and then restart my phone music. So far it really has been perfect.Noise cancellation: Better than Bose and Sony, who have, until now, been battling for first place. They just lost that. Adjustable setting is great too. (Off, Normal and High)Environment mode: Sony have this but the pass-through audio is not very good. On the Shures the sound is very natural, and the level is variable through the app, which I find super helpful, especially when on calls, so I can hear my own voice naturally rather than muffled, or in the case of the Sonys, distorted.Music fidelity: Being Shure, with nearly a century of experience in this space, there is no doubt these come very high in the entry-level audiophile headphone space. They are no Audeze, Grado or other $1000-and-up cans, but for the money, they perform exceptionally well. I won't try to go into audiophile details as I believe this to be a very personal, subjective experience, but suffice it to say that in my experience they outperform Sony and Bose significantly (the Sonys are very highly rated for sound quality) and they have the added benefit of an analog connection through a standard headphone jack (3.5mm -> 2.5mm cable included) OR full digital through the USB-C port.Aesthetically, although this is not my top criterion, these do look a significant cut above their competitors, so if you like something a little more unique and quality-oozing, these will cut the mustard.Size: Yep, they're big.

Also, the ""electronic noise"" seems to be gone so maybe I had a bad pair to begin with. I'm still frustrated with the firmware/features.Original review ...As a fan of Shure pro audio products, I am really disappointed in the Aonic 50. It's been about 9 months since I got them and now they won't power on. I guess we'll see if Shure decides to do anything about that. On top of that, the electronics/firmware design is infuriating: multi-paring regularly causes problems with playback, and if you plug them in directly, you still have to connect with bluetooth then manually disconnect in order to not have the ""bluetooth pairing"" prompt go off every 30 seconds. On top of that there's a lot of ""electronic noise"" in the background blipping in and out regularly; for headphones that were praised for audio quality in reviews, these have some major issues.At this point I just wish I could get my money back.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023",AFVT44J7W3RNSDEMP5EIJIVX2FDQ,TRUE,0,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1

They are not, however, a great overall set of headphones. The audio quality is really good. It sounds crisp and clear and the bass is solid, but not boomy. While large, the build quality is is very solid and these things look good. They are also very comfortable, but beware the earcups are not as deep as some others if that is what you need for comfort. However, just about every other feature they offer, you can do better elsewhere. Some might even say the sound quality is better elsewhere (very subjective).Noise canceling is average. There is definitely an audio loudness difference between the low and max setting. They also sound a little different when using the two levels of noise canceling (at least to my ears). Transparency is pretty good. There is nothing you can adjust in between. They are not the lightest headphones available, but they are comfortable. They are not, however, good to wear while moving around. I could hear a lot of creaks and had a lot of movement while walking. The app is very basic. There is an EQ but it only works for music that is played through the app so it cannot be used to stream Spotify, Apple Music, etc. The case this thing comes in is just huge. It makes travel almost a non-starter. Battery life is average at best.So why did I give them 4 stars? They are comfortable on my ears and they sound great. These are a pretty good first set of noise canceling headphones for Shure. I expect the next version to be even better. If you are looking for the best noise canceling or the best all-rounds, look to Sony or Bose.

If they're not too heavy for you, you might find them perfectly comfortable, as do I.Sound - These sound great (I also use ATH M50s and Senn. HD 6XX & 600s for reference). Make sure you have your codecs and all that straight - on Android you have to enable LDAC. I've been listening on Amazon Music HD They simply sound great. You hear everything - the drivers on these won't let you down and the low frequency response favors higher bass, and rolls off lower bass. These sound nice and clear as a result - no mud. If you love a lot of low end, maybe you'll need to EQ it in.Connectivity - Bluetooth 5, so make sure you have you're drivers and antennas up, and these will work. They connect automatically once paired. Connected to my phone and PC, while watching Netflix on PC, a phone call will pause the video and come through the headphones seemlessly.I have a couple gripes/suggestions. These are far from deal breakers and I didn't consider them in my scoring.1 - I wish the hinges opened both ways - so I can lie them flat either way. Right now you can only turn the hinges outward - think taking headphones off and you want to turn the ears so they can lie flat, these turn the opposite way my brain thought they should. Overall they could improve the foldability - the case is comically large due to the their structural rigidity. More of a note... not a problem2 - ANC Switch - You can only access the option to choose Normal vs Max ANC in the app. Whichever you have chosen will be the option available via the hardware switch. Top to Bottom the options are Environment Mode (works fine btw), off (normal headphone function, and ANC (Max OR Normal). I wish the hardware switch somehow had an option to pick Normal vs Max ANC, instead of it being locked in the app.The switch works better with 3 options - hardware wise - so I'm unsure how they'd do it, but I want it.3 - EQ App Music Only - These can's app's EQ only apply to the songs you have loaded in the app. It would obviously be nice if this was universal EQ.

I have seen reviews before about the huge hard case it comes with, which I thought it'd be inconvenient to me to carry around later if I commute back to work every day when the normalcy is back. I still wanted to get my hands on it just because of the sound quality that I can expect from Shure. It didn't disappoint me on that, of course, the ANC or phone call performance are not as good as Sony WH-1000XM3 or Bose 700, I'd still have kept it if the multipoint bluetooth connection failed after nearly 3 weeks of daily use. Since the pandemic began, I have been working from home using my TV/computer/cell phone together, so having a headphone that can connect my TV/computer & cell phone together is a huge plus for me, this way I wouldn't miss a call from clients or zoom meeting with coworkers. After using it for about 3 weeks, it suddenly stopped doing so, even I had it connected to both devices, the headphone wouldn't play back/pick up where it stopped yet both devices showed paired to my headphone. I was unable to control it to end my call or play my music/TV sound, I have tried to reset it or back to factory setting, none of them worked. I also tried to contact customer service to get this resolved and nothing changed. I assumed I was bad luck & had a defective set, now I'm not sure if I should try my luck again to get another pair or give it a try on the B&W PX7 or wait for Sony XM4 (and hoping they would provide a complete multipoint connection).All in all, the sound is great, ANC & call audio can be better to compete with other competitors like Sony/Bose, and if EQ adjustment from the app can be applied to audio played from other apps (like Tidal) instead for music played from its app only, I would give this a 4 stars if I had a good set.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2020",AH6XRTYCNBSODBKWQGUU2M2QZ6FQ,TRUE,4,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1

R1TTH8IR0HH4ZN,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely superb sound,Jesse Tampio,5,"When I went to replace my Bose QC35IIs to take advantage of the great sound quality on Tidal (a huge improvement over Spotify by the way), I did a lot of research on ANC over-ear headphones and tried the following: Bose 700s, Sony XM4s, Sennheiser Momentum 3, Master and Dynamic MW65s, Hifiman Deva Pros, Beyerdynamic Amirons and these Shure Aonic 50s, which are the only ones I have kept. The main selling point on these is the extraordinary sound. After I tweaked the EQ to my preference (a little more bass and high treble) they are a totally game-changer, with an extraordinary spatial separation and detail. The sound on the Amirons and Deva Pros might be better, but the former is way too heavy and slides around when you move and weren't worth almost 3x the price, and the Deva Pros were way too big and have tons of leakage. The Momentum 3 were almost as good sound-wise and have better features, but the headband hurt my head. Coming back to these Aonic 50s, the ear pads are nice and soft but the hole is a little too narrow, I wish they were wider so gave my ears a little more space. Its also annoying that they are proprietary, limiting the replacement options. If they do another generation of these, I would love to see them add auto-pause when you remove the headphones, and to improve the portability (I got a different case on Amazon that's more compact). And the ANC is nowhere near Bose or Sony, although its not bad. But regardless of any nitpicks, the sound on these is game-changing -- I am hearing details and nuances to songs on every listen!","Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2022",AF34TYLJADZLH2FIPEIXP76T7XQQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1

I live and work in a place with a lot of traffic noise so I need them. I was skeptical since I am picky about audiophile sound quality. I've been using them for a month now and overall I'm happy with them.The noise cancellation is very good for traffic rumbling and other low to mid-frequency disturbances. It isn't quite as good at higher frequencies but is sufficient for me. I have nothing else to compare them too so it is possible there are better ones.The sound quality through Bluetooth is good from my laptop but isn't outstanding. My source files are FLAC. BT sounds lossy which it is: they lose some of the high frequencies and ""sparkle"" and details like room reverb. BT is acceptable for listing while I work or do tasks around the house. However, for critical listening I connect the cable to my Fiio DAC and they sound very good. I would say the sound is neutral with BT and slightly bright when plugged in by cable. The BT sync with the computer is almost instantaneous when I turn them on. BT range is decent but if I go into different rooms I do get an occasional cutout.The build quality of these is great. The frame is aluminum and sturdy. They fit me well but I have a thin head.

R1GLS8YUD5MN9J,B084S1CYKF,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent but overpriced.,Brandon,3,"I was very disappointed with the noise cancellation on these headphones. The passive cancellation provided by the thick and comfortable padding is great, and the fit is pretty good even if they're a tad heavy. The ANC, however, hardly does anything on its normal setting. Set to max, it hardly improves at all with the added cost of an uncomfortable, constant hissing noise. The only other experience I have with ANC is a $65 pair of Tozo NC9's, wireless earbuds, and I honestly think those cheap little earbuds do it better.The sound quality is great. It took a bit for me to get used to how the Aonic 50's sound because I'm used to the more consumer friendly, bass emphasized headphones. Once I took the time though, it felt like I was hearing everything how it was meant to sound, as if I were in the room with people as they were recording. Call quality is okay at best. I tried talking to several people using different phones and apps, and they always said they preferred when I talked using a $10 pair of wired headphones from the general store. It gets the job done if you have nothing else, but definitely don't get them expecting clear conference calls. The app sucks. The only useful function it has is choosing the level of ANC you want. The equalizer in the app only works with songs that are downloaded on your phone and are also on the app. Battery life is as advertised, no issues there.If you're only going to listen to music in a fairly quiet environment, great! These may be for you. If you're also paying with expectation of other functionalities, I would go for something else. I would honestly pick my $65 earbuds over these.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2021",AEPIHUH7EE7GVLPVWSJJ25JO7XKQ,TRUE,2,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1
R6H7VOWP914FS,B084S1CYKF,2.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Sound but...,J,2,"These headphones deliver a fantastic sound. Though I am not an audiophile, I know that i appreciate the sound quality. Once I tweaked my equalizer in Microsoft Groove, they sounded amazing. Lows are low, and highs are high. There's no distortion at full volume. I don't listen to music on full volume since I'd like to keep the hearing I do have left. I was just curious and tried it out.I'm not a big user of noise cancellation, but these don't seem to cancel out outside noises very well. I have the headphones on the highest setting, yet I can still hear my mechanical keyboard clicking away as I type. I can't believe my keyboard would be that loud. So, take the noise cancellation rating with a grain of salt. Interestingly, they rated as having better noise cancellation than the Bose 700 headphones, though. Still - grain of salt.Another odd issue is that, when I am listening to music through my computer and receive a phone call while my phone is also connected to the headset, the computer music won't play after hanging up. Instead, my phone takes over and wants to play music from there. I have to disconnect the headphones from the phone. I'm not sure if that's an issue with the iPhone or the headphones. It's annoying, though.I have read horror stories about the earpads coming apart and the leather on the headpiece coming apart. I just got these, so that's not happened to me. But, it's something to be aware of. More importantly, it's important to be aware that, despite there being a part number for the earpads, you can't find them anywhere online or through Shure's store. I did find some in England, but the were both expensive and sold out. So, this is something to consider if you're a heavy headphones user.The range on these isn't as good as my $35 MPow headphones. One would think the range would either the same or better. Perhaps I own a aberrant pair of MPow headphones. I don't know. All I know is that the range isn't as good. The Acronis 50 headphones are leagues above those MPow headphones in sound quality and volume, though.One last thing is that finding the volume and power buttons can be a chore. They are almost flush with the headphones. There's a button in between the up volume and down volume button that allows you to pause, go back, or go forward tracks that's a little higher. That's how I finally realize where they were.3/1/2023 EDIT: The earpiece is falling apart and the headpiece is falling apart.

R1GTHK43AS5MDD,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Exactly what I needed,The Fishers,5,"This is my first set of Bluetooth noise canceling headphones and I love them for their comfort, sound quality, and long battery life. I was slow to adopt as sound quality never used to compare favorably to a set of wired headphones but that’s no longer really the case.My son has had several noise canceling headphones and said these definitely aren’t as effective as his, in terms of noise cancellation. That feature isn’t as important for me as most of the time I’ll be using these in my quiet home office. I actually thought to buy them so my son doesn’t have to hear my music playing during the day.I did do a fair amount of research (about an hour of reading) and elected not to try the equivalent Sony model as other reviewers said Sony choices were not as comfortable. I did try the Sennheiser Momentum 3. Those were comfy and had some nicer features, like pausing playback when you took them off. Plus I just like Sennheiser. Ultimately the Shure set has the bright, crispy upper frequencies, excellent fidelity across the frequency range, and superb soundstage that I prefer. If bass response is more important to you than upper frequency crispness, you might like the Momentum 3. While the Shure product can hit the low frequencies just as well, the Sennheiser product emphasizes bass out of the box. I would call it bass heavy. I prefer the more even bass treatment myself offered by other Sennheiser products and this Aonic 50. I did consider the Sennheiser ear buds as well (Momentum True Wireless 2) as I own the prior model without the active noise cancellation, but wanted to give this over the ear style a try. I’m glad I did! Count me a new fan of Shure products.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2021",AHP7TITFQXWKGHBAW76C76FBT7CA,TRUE,0,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1

R29PU4QS4MF04B,B084S1CYKF,2.0 out of 5 stars Best sound in its category that I bought; BUT MINE SEEM USED,SteveCS,2,"These headphones have by far bested any pair of premium headphones I have ever owned when it comes to sound quality. If that’s your main concern, these have you covered. This is of course, after installing the latest firmware in the Shure app. Which I would highly recommend you do first as it allows the headset to tune the EQ within the hardware itself. Additionally, it also fixes some compatibility bugs with the noice cancelling and EQ which messed with the sound quality before.Important things to note:1. Using the EQ forced the headphones to reduce the noice cancelling potency to the point where it almost doesn’t exist. It’s a trade you have to do.2. The ANC does not come close to the competitors like Sony (wh-1000xm5) and Bose 700. Do not get these expecting to get blown away by the ANC. (Even in max). Buy these for the sound.3. Built quality is good, not amazing. I would recommend buying some 3rd party pads instead as they are replaceable. These stock pads will probably last 1-2 years. So an extra 60 ish dollars if you go with that option.4. Like most modern wireless headphones, these have firmware that need to be updated out of the box. Unlike Apple, they actually do something. Like the hardware based EQ improvement I mentioned before. This is a must as it also fixes some issues seen with the LDAC coded.5. The soundstage is amazing, it makes the Sony xm5 sound like a small square box.REASON FOR 2 STARS:Now a complaint from the seller: I have bought these before and decided I wanted to gift my old pair; hence I know how the packaging is supposed to look like. These do not have the white plastic ring that acts as a ""seal"" to the product as the first ones I bought (in other words mine are not new), and as you probably guessed, mine arent working as intended. Rattle sounds can be heard while on get worst when you connect the cable. Furthermore, the right earcup is going on and off.I am returning them and buying them from a more reputable seller.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2022",AHDL7XUGEMIOACJMUZC6W7JOCVFA,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1

I have a pair of Sony headphones too- that app is slightly superior in that the sound setting choices are a little more variable. The audio however is very clear on these Shure headphones. What I like most is there is a great sense of space in these headphones- the instruments sound like they are being played on a vast stage.I returned a pair of Bowers and Wilkins for these because the B&W seemed to have touch controls that were way too sensitive- causing the headphones to stop a lot when I didn't mean to pause them.These sound just as good, fit on my head better, and don't have fickle controls that cut the sound out= giant bonus.The noise cancellation is average at best.

I've always expected nothing but the best sound quality possible, and these haven't let me down whatsoever. If you're someone who prioritizes audio quality, just pull the trigger. I couldn't ask for more when it comes to how many codecs these cans support. I've basically switched over exclusively to LDAC now on my phone and the detail coupled with a 24/48(96 etc) streaming service like Amazon's own Amazon Music HD has made me truly enjoy the experience of music again. Albums that I've purchased in the past few years sound like I'm listening to some of them for the first time.Noise Cancellation is great. I notice it takes a lot more out of low rumble sounds compared to Bose and Sony, but I do think Sony wins at cancelling out voices. But this is something you'll enjoy more so on a plane, or public transportation. I don't really have issues with environmental noise while music is playing at anything more than 50% really, much like another reviewer stated.Update Summer 2020: I used to hear a lot of distortion on the top end when utilizing LDAC. Problem has been fixed as well as microphone improvements when making calls!Update July 2022: these headphones keep getting better. The vegan leather on the headphones did start to come apart, shure replaced it very quickly within a week. The customer service experience was really easy. I tossed them in a cheap usps flat rate box and in came brand new headphones in original packaging . As I said, took about 5-6 business days in total as I didn’t pay for next day shipping.

When compared to other more well known brand names they perform as equals. I have used them primarily for home movie watching action films, so I don't force my wife to endure the louder soundtrack and mostly without the ANC on. When there is background noise I want to block out, the ANC does a great job of letting me just focus on music/movie. I have these paired with a aptX-HD bluetooth transmitter from my TV. I notice zero lag and truly amazing sonics for a wireless signal. The tight, full bodied bass and overall very well tuned frequency response rivals some of my closed-back wired headphones for balance, dynamics, comfort and great build quality. Would highly recommend these, even to audiophile-type listeners. Another feature I really like (and wish others would copy) is the voice battery level notifications. Probably the only fault would be slightly lower ANC performance vs Sony, with an emphasis on slightly. Sony/Bose need more competitors like Shure to keep the industry innovative and consumer friendly. This is longest review I've posted in a while, because these were such an amazing find.

I own the top models from JBL, Bose, B&W, B&O, and Master & Dynamic so i have a little comparison reference. Overall sound quality, sound detail, & sound balance are top notch 5 of 5 stars. Where these really shine is in the soundstage & depth of the music. You can literally percieve auditory direction & distance, as if you are sitting on the stage or in the studio & the music performance is in 3D around you. Truly emersive, and the BEST that i have ever experienced. As for the noise cancelling, i also rated 5 of 5 stars. I bought the Bose 700 at the same time & have been going back & forth every day for a month now. The difference isnt how much they block out, its the frequencies. The Bose seems to do a better job cancelling high to mid level frequencies while the Shure cancels mid to low frequencies better. I find that both cancel 99% of all outside noise if i have music at even very low levels. Fit & comfort are the BEST ive ever experienced. I have worn them for 8 to 10 hours straight on numerous occasions with zero discomfort. I have had no hardware, software, or pairing issues whatsoever. Control are easy & intuitive & better than aggrivating touch controls on Bose 700.

The sound quality is amazing, and the noise cancellation is one of the best I've tried for over-the-ear headphones. However the biggest problem with these headphones are that they're nearly impossible to charge if you lose the supplied USB cable. I've tried about 15 different USB-C cables, as well as 5 different wall chargers, and none of them have been able to charge the headphones. Only the USB-C cable that came with the headphones has been able to charge them. Due to this, now that I've lost the original USB-C cable that came with them, they're now essentially a really expensive paperweight.The other problem with the headphones is the relatively cheap construction of the ear cups. While they feel comfortable, after a couple months of use the leather is pulling off from around the side of the ear cups.

Due to pandemic, I now working from home with all kinds of noises and mostly from kid's home school. With Aonic 50's ANC, it's not effective enough to cancel most of noises in my environment. I ended up returning this wonderful unit because of the popping noise and lack of ANC. By the way, it is worth mentioning, the Sony XM4 has the most effective ANC, but I get headache wearing it. The B&W PX7 has all around features, and better ANC for my home office environment. It is a tough decision to return the Aonic 50 because of the sound quality, comfort, and mic for conference calls (the best out of three headphones).","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2021",AE3LHNRVAD75WYYE5D6RI5MWW5QA,TRUE,4,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1

They will still pair with my phone or my pc but they won't make a sound. I have contacted SHURE for warranty assistance and I'll update this review to let everyone know how they handle the problem.UPDATE:Shure asked me to call them to discuss the problem. I spoke with an engineer, in Florida I believe, who was extremely helpful and easy to talk with. He told me that the headphones try to connect to the last bluetooth device that they were connected to. In my case that was my stereo system. My iphone said that it was connected to the headphones when in fact they were connected to the stereo. The stereo was off so no sound!The Shure engineer told me how to easily reboot the headphones to remove all memory of previous connections and start over with my iphone. It worked just fine. It looks like having multiple bluetooth devices running at the same time will create a problem for any bluetooth headphones since they can only connect to one device at a time.These headphones are what you'd expect from a high-dollar device- comfortable, really nice-looking, and they sound great.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2021",AGW5YOZIERESUN323X5TC4WNHI7Q,TRUE,0,Color: BrownStyle: Gen 1

The sound quality is what you expect from Shure studio monitor phones: brutally honest and yet untiring. I find I can listen to these cans all day and not have tired ears or sore ear lobes. Just like I expect from Shure professional cans. I don't think I would use these wirelessly in the studio though, but I would definitely use them in the direct connect digital-over-usb mode they project. The accuracy is excellent that way. I have no reservations whatever using these with Apple gear or prosumer gear, they are totally compatible and worth every penny.The phones work well with many MS Windows applications but Skype for Business has occasional problems with both pairs of multipoint headphones I have. When not using the multipoint feature (two devices connected to the headphones at the same time) the Aonic 50 headphones work well with all the Windows applications I've tried. I've also connected them to Apple TV, that worked great. The environment feature and noise cancellation work very well. The noise cancellation affects the sound quality of music less that any noise cancelling headphones I've tried out.

These do a decent job of blocking steady background noises like AC, and they work great on airplanes. I usually leave noise cancelling off unless I am in a noisy environment. I never need to use the ""transparent"" mode—it is easy enough to hear the surroundings when noise cancelling is off. The built in mic works well enough.

R2GGFINT5NBV1M,B084S1CYKF,5.0 out of 5 stars Depends on what you want.,Amazonian,5,"This is hands down the best sounding wireless headphone or wireless noise-canceling headphone for that matter...IMO. The Brief. Neutral Signature with no coloration. Very detailed and transparent especially in the mids and highs (not bright at all). Bass is accurate and fast but will not appease bass heads. The sound is textured with the perfect amount of body.The app simply does not work well. I suspect Shure will fix this. Sounds good in Bluetooth (APTX-HD) and wired. I have yet to try the USB DAC function. Shure has concentrated the tech where it matters most to them, getting the best sound quality and so they have included all the major Bluetooth codecs, included a wired DAC function and focused on the drivers.I read a few reviews suggesting the noise canceling is better than Bose 700. That is simply not true. A few issues. The noise-canceling is not as effective as the Bose (for all categories of external sound). However it is good enough, so this is not the major issue. What I dislike more is the noise cancellation colors the sound signature making it warmer. I like Bose 700 for what it is. It's a great noise-canceling headphone for travel (especially air travel where noise canceling is the most paramount) but the sound is very thin and sculpted compared to the Shure's. The Shure's sound much better and noise-canceling is sufficient for office home use.So basically if you place sound quality above all else, and you are looking for a neutral, accurate sounding headphone which is also Bluetooth and has a USB dac. This will work for you. Think as the noise cancelling as an added plus.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2020",AHJKK5VN57PVQ2CNPQUG7PVWEN6Q,TRUE,58,Color: BlackStyle: Gen 1

Also, a pleasure to listen to with classical music, especially piano. However, all of this aside, the noise canceling is terrible! In fact, I think that there is the addition of noise that isn't there with the canceling off. A kind of wind sound in some situations. These things really only take the edge off of the environmental sounds. Bose did a better job with their first-generation noise canceling from 15 years ago. I will probably keep them, because I like the sound signature, and I own two other noise canceling headphones for when I need that feature.

It's not covered by the warranty and is considered a wear item. Replacement earcups aren't readily available yet, one has to call the company to order them because they haven't been added to their online store due to stock issues. (this per customer service person I spoke with)Battery life is good but they are slow to charge even on a fast charger. The main benefit of USB-C is fast charging but if the BMS isn't designed to take advantage of the extra amperage, it's really quite pointless.Bluetooth range is very good but the warning on loss and reacquisition of signal is inconsistent. Sometimes it just goes silent. When silent, there is random popping/clicking. Dynamic range is not as good as some of the competition. Active noise cancelling is essentially missing. I have closed back headphones that provide more sound isolation without being advertised as noise cancelling. The mic is terrible, people tell me I sound like I'm in a tin can and they can hear all the background noise surrounding me.One thing these excel at is being sturdy and secure on my head/neck. The hinges, which are always a weak point on headphones that pivot, are exceptionally well made. If only Shure would partner with the competition we could have the best of both worlds.

Good noise cancelling.,Pamela D,5,"Purchased both the Shure Aonic 50 and the Bose 700 noise cancelling headphones.Both are really good headphones, but they excel at different things.IMHO the Shure Aonic 50 have better sound quality when listening to music. They support the high def codecs such as aptX HD and LDAC. Listening to music on Amazon's HD Music service using my Samsung S20 phone (using BlueTooth LDAC) is almost as good as using a decent wired headphone. The Bose 700 does not support aptX or LDAC.The Bose 700 does a little bit better with the noise cancelling and with call quality, but not by much.The Shure Aonic 50 will allow you to continue using them while charging. The Bose 700 does not.I personally felt the Shure Aonic 50 was a little more comfortable for extended periods than the Bose 700.For me, the sound quality, comfort, and ability to use while charging matter more.

R2POMI5PGBQPLX,B0BS1QCFHX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones I Ever Owned, Especially for the Money",Zachary Woodman,5,"I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2023",AGMWH7HS3PQFXRDYXMTVGLO7PWKA,TRUE,233,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone

Great deal and solid quality for Price,Katie,5,"First and foremost, I have had these headphones for a few months and now feel comfortable giving a solid review.I truly love these headphones. I am not exaggerating when i say i use these daily. The sound quality is great (it’s obviously not the best ever but for $99 it’s a 10/10 for me). They completely cover your ears, and there is very minimal noise leak when they are on your head which i was very concerned about. They are also super lightweight and don’t hurt your head. They are easy to use and pair. Also another GREAT thing is the latency is great too. I’m an avid YouTube watcher and if the sound wasn’t matching with the voices these would have gone RIGHT BACK however, the latency is basically non existent. The final thing that is GREAT..AMAZING about these is the charge. It will hold a charge for DAYS. I kid you not, they have never once died on me. I work from home so i will have them on and in use all day long and i swear on my life they will only be 70% by the end of the day!! These are truly a solid pair of headphones and worth every penny! They also come with a cord so you can have them corded as well. Also as far as people have told me, the microphone pics up your voice just fine. The noise cancellation option is great too. I liken them to Beats in that regard. They also get hella loud!My only issues would be that they do FEEL kinda cheap but the performance outshines that. Also they do not listen for Siri commands and as far as i know you can’t change the song or go back on a song with the headphones.

The sound is well-balanced and can be adjusted through the EQ if needed.Versatility/Features: 3.5/5These headphones are versatile enough for a light run or gym session if you prefer over-the-ear headphones for workouts. However, they are best suited for lounging and listening to music. A standout feature is the ability to touch and hold one earphone to temporarily allow ambient sound while in noise cancellation mode.

RSSUGTMRKK05B,B0BS1QCFHX,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent headphones but wrong cost,Amazon Customer,3,"Decent but comparing these to other headphones I've owned, both a cheaper and more expensive pair, the price does not justify the product. Pros vs cons:- Quality: this is a con for me, the cheap plastic makes it lightweight but I cannot see these being durable. The Pads feel similar to the cheaper pair I've owned and possible to breakdown easily over time/use.- Sound: this is a pro for me, the sound is actually really great and will definitely be the highlight of the cost you spend on these. I mean this is the biggest reason we buy Headphones, right? The question is if the sound is really $150 worth? Ive experienced cheaper headphones with just as good of sound.- Ease of use: this is a pro for me, the connectivity seems to be seamless and Google connection is a plus.- Comfort: this is a con for me, the pads at both the ears and top make this a difficult headphone to wear for multiple hours.- Noise Cancellation: this is a con for me, and while the NC does work, it seems to be directional and compared to others I own, this doesn't work nearly as effective.- Look: This a pro for me, since these are more sleek they do give a better appeal than my bulkier headphones.Overall this is my personal experience and preference, if you decide to buy you may feel differently. In my honest opinion, the market for headphones is so vast and there are a lot better options at a more affordable cost. If cost is less of an issue, spend a bit more and go with something even better. This product should not cost more than $100","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AHVSY6MSXFWWSU5R2ML5LA4NY4FQ,TRUE,3,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphone
RL93HUK667R9P,B0BS1QCFHX,5.0 out of 5 stars A lot to love at a decent price,Brian,5,"SECOND UPDATE - 11/9/2023 OK, so I have been living with these for a couple of months now and I feel I can say some things with more confidence.1. Comfort is still a bit hit or miss. I will say the choice to put those microphones or whatever those things that stick out on the insides of the earcups was not great. I don't always feel them pressing on my ears but the earpads are not very thick and if you don't have them on in exactly the right way (assuming you can find a way that works for you) then the pads will flatten a bit and you'll feel them on your ears. It's not exactly painful. Just unpleasant. 2. And I feel the need to come back to the ear cushions themselves. Again, they just barely fit over my ears. And I wear glasses so this is a big issue with most headphones. I can sometimes get the cushions just right so they don't smash the tips of my ears against the arms of my glasses too much but it sometimes takes a bit of extra fiddling around with them that can be annoying when I'm not in the mood for it. Again, not too much of a knock against Sony since this is a widespread issue with headphones in general. Manufacturers just seem to think if they make the cushions soft, they will be comfortable. Nope. If it smashes your ears, it will start to hurt after a while no matter how soft it is.3. The battery life is decent but I do find myself having to charge them more often than I expected. Prior to these, I had an inexpensive pair of Jlab headphones and although their sound quality and features were lacking, the battery life was outstanding and I was just used to not charging for days and days. I pretty much wear headphones all day every day and I generally find that these will be at 50% after a couple of days. Of course that's with noise cancelling on. But also, these are noise cancelling headphones so they were designed to be used with it on for long periods. Or should have been. I don't know what the capacity of the battery is in these but the battery packs they use in wireless headphones are not expensive items anymore. You can buy a set of $30 wireless headphones now with a huge capacity battery. So, yes. These are lower end Sony but they're still well above the price you pay for really basic wireless headphones. They shouldn't have skimped on the battery capacity. That said, though I haven't actually kept track of how many hours, it probably does meet the stated runtime. I had just hoped they were being conservative with the numbers. But also, you can't use them and charge them at the same time so if you use your headphones constantly, that can be annoying. I don't like to run lithium batteries much below 50%. I don't know that it's bad for them exactly but all of my lithium batteries have lasted me for many years using that policy so that's what I do. When I see 40-50% I charge the battery. I know they have the quick charge feature but I like to charge and forget for many hours. It would be more useful if I could plug into a power bank for 15 minutes and still use the headphones while it's charging. But nope. You plug into a charger and the headphones turn off. Everything said, I'm reasonably happy with them but I paid the $150 asking price they were selling for when I bought them. Knowing all I know now, I would not pay that price again for these. These are $70 headphones. Tops. They're not that comfortable. The battery life is easily matched (or surpassed) by the least expensive wireless headphones on Amazon. The stock sound quality is not impressive at all. (I will say they sound pretty good if you tweak the EQ). The only things I have been really happy about is once I got them paired with my PC, they always connect right away when I turn them on. That's something that is hit or miss with most bluetooth devices. And can be incredibly annoying when you have to fight to get something connected every single time. I've also been pretty satisfied with the noise cancelling. Which they're the first NC headphones I've ever owned so I have nothing to compare them to. I'm not really understanding what Sony was trying to do with these. Their top of the line ANC headphones might be some of the best ANC but are they really $400 good? Well, if they're anything like these, they are good but significantly overpriced.UPDATE - 9/25/2023 I realize my original review is a bit long and probably most people don't want to read all that so after living with these for a week or so, here are some key points that I think people will want to know.1. Comfort is just OK for people with small or medium ears that don't stick out too far. Beyond that, the comfort might be anything from uncomfortable to painful.2. The ANC is good enough for me. I don't fly. I don't use them on a bus or train or anything. I use them at home. They block out things like computer fans and voices in adjacent rooms. I have a fan right by my head and although I can still hear it, the ANC really tames it to a very gentle hiss. If voices or TV are in the same room with you, it will cause them to seem to recede quite a bit but you will still probably hear them (especially TV). The ANC works better on some frequencies than others. It almost eliminates some noises but (for example) the sound of water running nearby is something you will definitely hear.3. I use these 90% with my Windows 10 PC and I have not experienced any of the disconnection issues that many have reported with them as long as I am only using them with my PC. However, when I do connect them to my Android phone, if I leave them connected for a while, things can get glitchy and if I then turn off the bluetooth on my phone, it will sometimes make weird things happen. Like if I have the ANC turned on on the headphones, it will turn off and forget the EQ settings I have chosen. Also, sometimes when I try to disconnect them from the phone by simply turning off bluetooth, they don't make the disconnect sound. I don't know. I'm glad I didn't buy them to use exclusively with the phone. I have a different set of headphones for that. I just wanted to include this in my review to note that I did indeed notice some issues when I left them connected to my phone for a while. I will be keeping them because PC is all I care about.END UPDATE---------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWThings that mattered to me in choosing these headphones...1. I'm not going to try and sugar coat this too much. I don't have money to burn. But a set of headphones that check all my boxes without doing anything I hate for a price I can handle is a tall order. Good headphones have never been cheap. ANC is still a premium feature (though this is changing fast). These headphones were just barely in my price range at $150. And frankly, although I like everything about them (so far) I think $100 would have been closer to the price these should be selling for. This segment of the market is crowded and if I was willing to gamble even more than I did, I could have probably gotten something I was happy with for significantly less than that $150. I went with Sony because I'm an old guy and I know that you usually don't pay more for a Sony product for no reason.2. Comfort. Of course, we're talking perceived comfort. Comfort involves a lot of guesswork. For these, it appears that I mostly guessed right. These just fit my ears with a little pressure here and there. My ears are not small but also not that large. If you have large ears, you should probably go somewhere where you can try the headphones on before you buy. I probably should have done this myself because comfort is always my top priority (other than price). Most likely the pads on these will not be difficult to replace should the need arise. And it usually does with headphones. Sooner or later, the pads will always wear out.3. ANC - Of course. This is my first pair of ANC headphones and it's everything I want. The transparency mode is slightly quieter than I would like but it's acceptable. I've seen some people complaining about the ANC not being effective on these. Not sure what they're talking about but maybe they're coming from much higher end ANC. For me, the first day I had them, I had some people come to see me and they were banging on my door. I heard absolutely nothing. They were freaked out because they thought something was wrong. So....my verdict on this is if you want perfect ANC, maybe shop around. I'm not here to tell you it's the best. I don't have anything to compare it to. I can only say it leaves me wanting nothing and I'm happy with it.4. Sound quality - Out of the box, I found the factory sound to be lacking. But that usually happens with me when I have new headphones. I can't say for sure if the burn in effect is psychological or real but all I can say is a new pair of headphones takes some getting used to for me. At least the EQ is sufficiently adjustable in the app and I managed to get them to sound very nice. It's nice that the settings you choose in the app will be stored in the headphones so the same settings will apply on other devices. I mostly use Bluetooth headphones on my Windows 10 PC so I'm not going to be fiddling around with the app much. These can go pretty loud and have decent bass. The drivers can provide good clarity for mids and highs if you fiddle with the EQ. The stock EQ sounds muffled. But that also might be a result of them not having been burned in. CONS - It's really nitpicking for me to find many cons. These are great headphones (at least initially).1. The buttons could be a bit more tactile. In particular, I find the play/pause button a bit difficult to find and always find myself hunting for it. It is right between the Vol +/- buttons and should stick out a little more than it does to make it obvious. Also, the ANC button is nearly flush with the earcup and still makes me hunt for it a bit more than I like. I think I'll get used to these buttons eventually but I don't love them.2. The shortest timer for the auto off that's available in the app is 15 minutes. I was really kind of surprised that there was no option for a shorter time.3. The headband is adjustable by clicks. So if the size you need is between two clicks, you might have to have them slightly too tight or slightly too loose. The higher end Sony headbands with no clicks seem like they would be better in this way.4. Although (as I said) the comfort is pretty good, it's not great. But this is not terribly unusual for lower end headphones. I strongly prefer over ear (earcups that surround the ears rather than sit on them and smash them) and I'm very picky about it. I don't like it if my ears are not completely inside the earcups and I don't think it's asking much since my ears are not enormous. I find that these do kind of smash the tops of my ears. It's not something I notice right away but after about half an hour or so, it starts to become something I'm almost constantly aware of. It's not exactly painful but it isn't really pleasant either. To make matters worse, there is a seam in the fake leather that runs all the way around the inside where your ear is probably gonna be if your ears are just slightly larger than the ears of a child. I find that many of these types of earpads have that seam and I don't know it's purpose but I know that ones that don't have it tend to be easier on your ears even if your ears don't fit perfectly. So all I'm saying is this isn't some upstart company. This is Sony. These are low end Sony headphones but they're still not really cheap and they're still made by an enormous company that's been around for many decades. I don't know what it is. Almost every company that makes headphones of this sort makes the earcups too small for even slightly larger ears. I guess they think people with larger ears don't use headphones. Of course my ears could be really large. In which case, I probably wouldn't be able to wear them even if they were a little larger.5. Also, I have to kind of agree with all the other reviews that mentioned the little plastic part that sticks out from the area where the driver is on the inside of the earcup. I am not sure if it actually pushes on my ears or not but it seems like it might. I kind of feel something and it does stick out far enough to where I can see how it could rub your ears. I think these pieces are the place where the microphones are mounted so if that's the case, they kind of have to be there but they probably don't have to be as poorly designed as they are. I feel like I might be able to trim some of the plastic off if I really wanted to but I'm not going to start working on a brand new set of $150 headphones. It doesn't bother me (yet) so maybe I'll change my mind later on. I think this could have been avoided if the padding were a bit thicker on the earpads.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2023",AFDM3GTGLU527LDCF2R5D2YWVJ5Q,TRUE,176,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
RDXZTSURXCBC2,B0BS1QCFHX,5.0 out of 5 stars These won out over every other set of headphones I tried,M.O.S.,5,"UPDATE 3/13/23: I noticed another reviewer mention that the padding has given out some after a while and I will concur that this has been my perceived experience as well. The padding flattens easily and I wish it was a bit more robust. I wouldn't say that the speakers are poking my ear, but I do feel my ear being pressed slightly and it does lead to minor discomfort over time. So I would say that the padding could definitely be better on these, and it should be at this price point. I would maybe deduct a half star for this if that was an option, but since it's not, I'm keeping my 5 star rating. I'm still happy with the sound, but I'll definitely be looking out for some better pads.Original Review:I'm impressed with these headphones. They are really good. I will, however, call out from the beginning that you lose some functionality and build quality (potentially - more on that below) seen in more expensive headphones and even though these are ""only"" $150, I think it's a bit pricey. But I think good headphones are just ridiculously expensive in general. With that out of the way, here are the headphones I tried in addition to the WH-CH720N: Sony XM4 & XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Soundcore Q30 & Q45, and Technics EAH-A800.My main objective in getting new headphones was to get a serious sound quality upgrade from the Soundcore Life Q20’s that I've had for several years now, and I was finally ready to pay $300-$400 for it if I had to. I was looking for clear mids and highs with deep, clear, separate bass (think of the difference between a sound system with a separate subwoofer vs a sound system without that tries to pack the bass into the main speakers). With the caveat that sound quality is subjective to the listener, here are my thoughts on each of the headphones I tried:Technics EAH-A800 - absolute garbage and a joke at their price. These didn’t even merit more than a few minutes of listening.Soundcore Q45 - disappointingly uninspiring sound compared to the much cheaper Q30. They lack bass. I spent very little time with these because I knew that I would take the Q30’s over them without question.Soundcore Q30 - These are very good for their price (compared to the other options at that price). If I hadn't been willing to spend $300+ for the best sound, I would have kept these despite the fact that they powered off in the middle of calls (a problem I believe is specific to OnePlus phones based on my research). But compared to more expensive headphones, the Q30's bass was not as well defined/separated and it bled into all the frequencies, lending to an overall muddy sound - comparatively. But these are good, and at their price point, I doubt you can find better headphones.Momentum 4 - These headphones had, hands down, my favorite bass signature; it was fantastically clean and able to hit impressive lows I could not hear in any other cans. The overall sound was very good, although I never could get them to sound as clear as I wanted once I experienced the 720's. The M4’s have fantastic battery life. Sadly, there were quite a few issues with the M4’s. They sound awful in wired mode - like, don’t even bother, they’re that bad. Taking calls on the M4s was a very weird experience; it’s hard to explain, but voices sounded kind of echo-y, but in the sense that it was like the voice was everywhere around me to the extent that I was sure that everyone else in the room was hearing the voice just as clearly as I was. I couldn’t decide if I liked it or not - all I can say for sure is that it was a very strange experience. The M4's had software bugs that I just couldn't overlook, such as the audio being out of sync with video when using aptx (I had to use the lower SBC format to get the audio in sync and this just didn't make any sense!). The touch controls and on ear detection were a bit of a hit or miss. Software updates are unreasonably slow - like 20 minutes or longer. They are quiet - I found that I had to crank them up well past 50% to get enough volume, but at the end of the day, it didn’t really matter because they did get as loud as I ever needed and still had the ability to go louder. And they are on the heavier side, which meant they didn't stay in place on my head if I looked down or up. I actually ordered a second pair hoping that the software issues were a defect, but the replacement had all the same issues. But that bass was so good I was tempted, even prepared, to overlook all of those shortcomings. Until I tried the XM5's and the 720's.Sony XM4 - I'm sure these were great for their time, but their age is evident. The sound was muddy and uninspiring to me. I quickly moved on from these.Sony XM5 - these are good - very good. I would have kept the XM5's if the 720’s hadn’t been released just as I was comparing all of these headphones. The sound is very close to the 720's, but just not quite as clear, though I think the bass may go a bit lower than the 720's. It really mostly came down to price when deciding between the XM5 and 720. The XM5's are feature rich with an excellent ambient mode (the best I’ve experienced). ANC is good, but not at the level I expected for their reputation and really not significantly better than most other headphones. Compared to the 720’s, I’d say the ANC actually blocked out less noise, but the XM5’s made almost no static sound with ANC on and that may have played into that perception because I think the slight static noise the 720’s make might just be covering up the external noises that I’m hearing more on the XM5’s. But getting the absolute best ANC was not the most important thing for me. I liked the touch controls on the XM5’s - it's easier than feeling around for the correct button. But is it worth the price? Not for me - I'll take the trade-offs of the 720's for the savings, especially since I think the 720's sound better. But I can easily see how someone would buy the XM5’s over the 720’s if money is not an issue.Finally, Sony WH-CH720N - these really are best described as the budget version of the XM5’s. Remember how I mentioned that they sound very similar to the XM5’s? Yeah, sometimes I forgot which headphones I was wearing, they are that close (post EQ-ing them to the best sound I could get from them). The ANC and Ambient modes aren’t quite as good on the 720's, they don’t have touch controls (a positive or negative depending on the person), and they don’t feel as solidly built (though I might argue that is only because of how incredibly light they are - they actually seem well built and there are no creaks, but their lightness is easily perceived as “cheap”). The 720’s don’t come with a case and they don’t fold (but the XM5’s don’t fold, either); not a big deal to me. Not folding just means they have fewer breaking points and are less obnoxious to handle when off the noggin. These live on my desk, so a case is not important to me. For traveling, I prefer the compactness of earbuds anyway. The auto off feature only works after they lose bluetooth connection, which for the majority of us, only happens if we turn our phone off or walk far away from the headphones. So, not significant value there, though I do turn off my phone every night, so the headphones will at least shut off at night if I forget to do it manually, and that is good enough for me. The 720’s are strictly controlled with physical buttons that are well placed, though I find myself expecting the ANC/Ambient button to be on the back, not the front (don’t know why, because it actually makes sense the way they did it), causing me to push the wrong button more than I’d like. And I wish the volume up and down were more distinct from the play/pause button. The buttons are my only real (but minor) complaint, but I'm getting used to the buttons and will be fine in short order. The 720’s are slim compared to the XM5’s and the M4’s. And did I mention they are light? They are insanely light and extremely comfortable. Most importantly, the 720’s sound really good. While they don’t quite have the bass signature of the M4’s, they are so well balanced and clear across all of the frequencies (without being harsh or sibilant) while still having great, clear bass that it could be argued that the 720’s sound better. I just kept finding myself going back to the 720’s over every other set of cans. These headphones won out over the rest from my limited (but targeted) comparison. There might be better sounding headphones out there, but I haven't found them.","Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2023",AGWCBQURF7TKPYVF4OTHIOZEU6DQ,TRUE,626,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R3DUD8062XSOP6,B0BS1QCFHX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Had a couple minor issues, but otherwise I totally love these!",Jj,4,"It arrived smelling minty fresh, which kind of threw me off initially... until I realized the alternative would probably be the scent of someone else's sweat lol! So kudos for that.It arrived with no issues and has been working very well for the last month. I'm autistic and having noise cancellation technology in my headset has been life changing for me. The way the noise cancelling in this headset works is completely tunable by the wearer. There's noise cancelling and ambient sound modes. I've included screenshots of the app you can use to fine tune it. The voice passthrough feature in itself is pretty useful, as if it's on the noise cancelling mode, hearing speech can be really hard. It's hard to explain, but with this feature turned on, if someone talks to you, it seems to briefly switch to ambient sound mode to hear speech near you. It's super fluid and will switch back within about a second of the speech ending. The only caveat with this feature, though, is that it seems to have to be rather loud (or very close) speech in order to be picked up. So if I'm holding a baby and it coos in my ear, it'll trigger the voice passthrough. But if someone is quietly talking to me a few feet away, I'll usually have to manually switch. Not a huge deal, but probably worth making a note of.I've also had one instance of garbled audio from my headset. I had to turn them off and back on to fix it. It happened suddenly on a phone call.Other than those two things, this headset has been amazing. I also want to say that the battery life is pretty amazing, as it can be used pretty heavily for at least a couple days without having to be charged. I'll be listening to audio for a few hours straight sometimes and it only drops the battery down about 10%. Also, the microphone quality is pretty good. Especially when compared to my older Bluetooth headphones that I used to use. People can actually understand me on the phone with these, which is really helpful if I need to talk to someone on the phone but don't want to hold my phone or can't. I'm so happy that I got these and also I'm happy at the fact that they were available refurbished so I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars to have these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2024",AH7VVTYVPLUI3AIH2LWXOMFM75BQ,TRUE,2,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R1DAPTTG9ZZ22P,B0BS1QCFHX,4.0 out of 5 stars Light and quality,Zoe xx,4,"These headphones are light, airy and they feel like holding a feather; however they’re not as easy to fly off in the wind. Their performance is amazing, I wish I didn’t have to download an app to really get full quality but that’s one downside. The sound quality if gravitating with the surround sound and the noise cancelation mode is great for going in crowded places, as someone who gets overwhelmed. I mowed the yard and with the NC my ears were much at ease from the loud noise. I love the build of the headphones, sleek but also angular and round at the right places. As a girl who loves to personalize things I wish there was more space on the surface of the cuffs to ass stickers but that’s just a small unneeded want. The ear cuts for ears perfectly, and they do not push down on your ears, or head; making wearing them for hours not leave slight pain like most headphones do. I love that pressing the power button once tells the user the battery power and pressing it for two seconds turns it off, it’s easy to use and does not require mass amounts of brain cells waiting to be lost. I have yet to test the durability as I just got them a day ago. On the other hand, the charging is impeccable. I received them at 60% charge and have been using them for quite some time and they are still, at 56%. Along with the NC mode the headphones also come with an ambient mode for everyday use, for people who want to hear their surroundings as a safety mechanism which is great versatility. One con I noticed soon inspection is that they don’t fold down like most headphones. Now I know they weren’t advertised like that but I still wish that was a quality. I bet there are much better quality and overall everything headphones out there but for a discounted prime day price 88$ which is cheap for headphones, (but not for my wallet) these are a steal and I give these an 8.5/10!","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AGFDSBWED5A7ZVP3COSNNO54X2ZQ,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R29EARG1RU48IA,B0BS1QCFHX,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad but they have one big flaw.,Sgt. Slab Wrankle,4,They are pretty decent headphones with good sound but my one big issue with them is you can't use them while they are charging. It will disconnect soon as you plug it into the charger. This is a huge issue for me because I sleep with headphones since I live by a big airport & need to sleep with noise canceling headphones. So if you're a regular headphone user who uses headphones almost 24/7 you may want to have a spare around. I'll have to use my old E7 headphones for this & rotate between the two instead of replacing my old E7 headphones with the new Sony headphones like I was hoping to be able to do. Its weird because much cheaper off-brand headphones I've tried can be used while they are charging so not sure why this went by Sony of all companies. Sound quality seems pretty decent & noise canceling seems to work for the most part & they are pretty comfortable. The manual could have been better illustrated & thought out like they could have mentioned the fact it can't be used while charging & maybe have a diagram of how to remove the ear pads & how to clean them. It's mostly allot of vague technical info with some basic instructions. Overall they seem decent but definitely feel like they are overpriced. They felt more like $100 or sub $100 headphones rather than over $150 headphones. This is just my first impression on them after going through many other brands & off brand headphones over the years.,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2024",AFAMGPOV26EZJNSDGHKLF3YYW2UQ,TRUE,0,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphone
R2S0W039U66C9M,B0BS1QCFHX,3.0 out of 5 stars Was impressed….Not so much anymore.,jenjaine,3,"Update 3/9……so first I’m going to say that I bought these with my own money before any reviews were out. Didn’t realize they were a vine product. After a few weeks of use the padding has relaxed enough so that I can feel the drivers poking my ears. I wear my headphones around 4 hours a day on weekdays and 8-10 hours on each weekend day. As stated earlier I have a smaller than average head, and my ears do not stick out. I can usually adjust the cups to be lower, but I don’t like them riding my jawbone.I would’ve have overlooked that because they do sound good, however they are now randomly disconnecting. I use them for YouTube and I’m literally 18 inches away and they disconnect. I check through the app and it shows a connection failure. If I pause a video, again, they show connected, but the sound comes out of my iPad. When I check the app it tells me there is a connection failure and to restart. While the sound is good I don’t think I care to restart my headphones every 10 minutes. Maybe they don’t like Apple devices? I’m not sure….I originally bought the xm5’s. I finally got them last week only to find they were quite oversized for my smaller than average head. The weight of them made matters worse as every time I looked down they flopped forward. I had to return them.I am not one of those fancy audio people but I know what I like. My previous headphone were the solo pro 3’s and I do enjoy them. What I don’t like is the pain my ears experience after about an hour of having them on.I wanted over the ear headphones and everything I read and all the videos I watched pointed me to the xm5’s which ended sadly. I searched Amazon and saw these were a new model. Looked up what little I could find online about them and the consensus was these were the cheap version of the xm5’s. Yeah, I’m sold so I got them.Build: They are cheaper feeling, not as bad as the 510’s, but nowhere near the xm5’s workmanship. But they are also not breaking the bank (as bad anyways, it still shocks me to see what headphones are going for nowadays). The sliding part is plastic reinforced by metal. I’ll be honest….I am wondering how they will hold up.Comfort:Excellent. These are super light. I don’t feel them resting on the crown of my head at all. There is no clamping on or around my ears. But the are secure on my head. The padding around the ear cups is decent and the cups are deep so most will not have their ears touching the speakers.Bells and whistles: these are old school, they have buttons…no swipe features at all. I like that because in my week of using the xm5’s I discovered quickly that volume adjustment was hit or miss with response time. It might be that my hands are always cold, but in 6 hours of wearing these I have already mastered the buttons. They are very well placed and very responsive.App: They are part of the Sony Headphone app. You get an equalizer and other customizable features including the ability to connect to two devices at the same time and it works great as I use the headphones for watching music videos on YouTube and Netflix. I use my phone to adjust the equalizer for the music playing on my iPad.Another feature on the app is you can set the headphones to shut off when not in use. I was excited about the auto shutoff feature. Not so much now. It is not sensor based nor is it based on when you device’s screen shuts down. It is based on when you turn of Bluetooth. This makes it worthless to me and maybe a lot of us who do not ever turn Bluetooth off. I think it could have been done better.Noise cancelling:I’m going to call this adequate. With my Beats Solo pro with ANC I can’t hear anything. Not even someone yelling. These will drown out the hum of a fan pretty well, but they let in a lot of ambient noise (like my husband coughing in the next room right now!). Even the xm5’s were not as good as the Beats. But the on ear style of the Beats may have something to do with that. So I’ll stick to the xm5’s comparison. I also want to say that there are supposedly 3 modes…noise cancelling, ambient and off. I have not noticed any difference between ambient and noise cancelling. There is no voice prompt to let you know which setting you are in. I will play some more to see if I’m missing a setting in the app and if something changes I’ll edit my review.Sound quality: (of course this is subjective to each person) Excellent out of the box and I could not say that about the xm5’s. My first mission was to find the equalizer when I took them out of the box and tried them. Not so with these. The sound was nice. I still tweaked it but if I wasn’t able to change it a bit, I would still be happy.Other:They do not come with a case. They do not fold. They come with an aux cord and charging cable, no charging block.Final thoughts: This is my fourth pair of headphones in a month. I was willing to drop over 300 bucks on a pair. And I didn’t like any of them. Most important to me is fit and sound. Most were severely lacking in sound quality. These are not. And they were cheaper.I am most disappointed in the build quality. I think they should’ve done better. To me $150 is alot of money to spend on headphones that feel this plasticy. And if they crack after 6 months I’ll be upset. I’m not expecting $350 quality, but better. These are not too much better than the 510’s when they should’ve been a little less than the 910’s. They are far less quality than the 910’s. Maybe I’m asking too much after coming from the Solo 3 pros and xm5’s which both have a superb build.BUT…..they make up for it in having great sound that you can totally adjust to your liking. They are comparable to the xm5’s in sound. And far superior I feel to the 910’s which just sound overly undefined bass. And the comfort!! It’s spot on.These are the best out there in terms of sound and app capabilities.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2023",AGXDFCDZA6AFQCJUJARL5E5KIL2A,TRUE,208,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R18PIARCYYP4QH,B0BS1QCFHX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love these headphones! Pairing , connecting and reconnecting is easy",living in ease,5,"First, the sound is great. Also, I like that I am able to have it set up to be able to connect to my phone, amazon firestick, and my laptop. It usually reconnects on it's own to what i was to use it with, but if it doesn't, it's not hard to reconnect it myself. The range is great on these too. I can walk away from watching something on tv and still be able to hear what is going on while I'm in the kitchen making supper or loading the dishwasher. I like that if i need to make a quick trip to another room and back, I don't have to unentangle myself from anything, or pause what I'm doing. I can keep listening. I also like the noise cancelling feature that blocks out the air conditioner. This is especially nice for watching movies, i get that movie theatre feeling . Highly recommend, especially for the price.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AFAFQ6YUENYLAZL6A6MUHLWQWPCQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R21II9255HTQLT,B0BS1QCFHX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Noise Canceling,Soul,5,"We bought these for our daughter upon her HS graduation and she absolutely loves them!! She wears them nearly every day when working around the house to listen to her podcasts. She has worn them on a plane to listen to music. She says the noise canceling function works great (and I have confirmed) and they are so light she can wear them for any length of time. The one complaint she has is they seem to disconnect occasionally from her iPhone for no apparent reason, though she's always able to reconnect them straightaway. At a price point of $100 or less, I don't think you can go wrong with these.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AGFKGTJOLCFH75ONNFEKNV5HNXLA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R3LSANG0LJ3S2I,B0BS1QCFHX,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound quality and active noise cancellation,AG,4,"Light weight good sound quality headphones with very good active noise cancellation and worth it at the price . I however, would not rate it close to a Bose system but this is a good active noise cancelling headphone which can be great for work as well as for travel . I will recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a decent lightweight headphone with good active noise cancellation at the advertised price . It is a good buy","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AG4NUR7FO2UPXDMCXUSUBO7ITZUA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R2NPRR39WVT9X3,B0BS1QCFHX,4.0 out of 5 stars very pleased,King,4,"I mostly wanted headphones to block out my loud neighbors when they have summer yelling parties outside my window and it works pretty damn well for that. One guy is a real crooner and whooper, and at most it sounds like he's a few houses down. Even when they play loud music, it's muffled if it comes through the noise cancellation barrier. The NC even blocks out any machine drone nearby; I can't hear my fans, A/C, fridge or the pool pump. It's honestly eerie but that silence is golden.I don't know if this is due to a software update or I just haven't explored the app update enough but it seems like when you pair to two devices at once, you have to choose a device to hear using the app, you can't stream both.I prefer having physical buttons on the headphones but the pricier versions of Sony's line use touch sensitive contextual movements to adjust volume, connect etc. I like that a NC and ambient mode button in on there, so I can switch on the fly if I need to.I like the fake leather plush on the main part of the band and on the ear cups but I am not sure how long that will hold up, it seems very delicate. However it is pleasant to touch. These stay comfortable on me for about an hour. The only reason I really take them off is because my ears get hot and sweaty. These really are lightweight (part of my reason picking them over cheaper competitors).The only problem I had pairing was initial setup but that was really my bad because I use a dongle to get bluetooth on my computer and the driver wasn't properly installed. So be aware if you have a bluetooth dongle for connectivity that it has to have the proper latest driver installed or else it will just not pair.THE REASON I RATE THIS FOUR INSTEAD OF FIVEYo, person at Sony forced to read these for a living, PLEASE pass this along. THE CHARGING CABLE. Bruh. BRuH! Look I get it I appreciate shorter cables, I am not charging things in another room or something, and I like to save space when I travel with a bunch of cables. But this short cable doesn't work on any of my pc's usb ports so I have to plug it into an adapter. The adapter brick is plugged into an extension cord on the floor, which means I can't put the headphones on my shelf at the same time, it doesn't reach. So I have to put the extension cord up on the shelf or put my headphones on the floor. For someone directly charging from a wall outlet, your headphones are gonna dangle half on the floor, half in the air. Even when I get the extension cord up on my shelf for charging, there is still not enough room for the headphones to lie flat if the adapter faces up. My workaround is that I rest the headphones on a holder on my desk and I can pull that down closer to the floor when I need to charge. BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE THAT LYFE. I should be able to just plug it into my pc and be able to put it safely on top of the PC or on a nearby surface, my choice, no major distance consideration to prohibit the safe placement. I really feel yall should send this with one small cable and one long one. Because the small is useful if someone uses a laptop or has a usb hub on their desk.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AG2Q7K7NJWYKH5TYAD7FHAM2JA4A,TRUE,15,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphone
R2X92VGPEEDGLX,B0BS1QCFHX,4.0 out of 5 stars It’s Great Best Budget Headphones,Austin,4,"Read so many review before choosing this, Out of thr box, you will need to EQ/customis your settings to preferences. It might sound muffled, as you will need to tweak the mids and highs as well.Over all I have enjoyed using this headphones .. for music listening pleasure , This is not a bad choice at all..Not all the bright crispy sound u might expect with high ends headphones, but this is decent.If you have all the $$ for the pricey headphones, go for itFor best budget , I’m not changing this headphones any time soon","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AHZDWZSVDDPG4RLRBHF5YW3QKW6A,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
R2G7XPVI5OZZXI,B0BS1QCFHX,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbelievable battery life,Calculatorio Montezuma,5,"These headphones saved me from going to jail for attacking my drum-playing neighbor. The noise-cancelling can't QUITE stand up to that much noise, but by playing white noise at a low volume under whatever you're listening to, I'm able to block out the band practice next door.The REAL selling point of these headphones imo, is the battery life. I can turn these on in the morning fully charged, use them ALL DAY, fall asleep in them, and they STILL have charge the next morning. When I get the low battery warning, I know I still have about 3 hours left, absolutely bonkers.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGTABKPSKVKMM2VKHBZMRV6BGG4A,TRUE,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone
